"SEOUL, South Korea — It read like typical North Korean propaganda: soldiers toiling on snowy hills near the border with China, racing to finish construction on a tourist resort and making great sacrifices for the glory of the state.",韩国首尔——这篇报道读起来就像是典型的朝鲜宣传：士兵们在中朝边境附近的雪山上辛勤劳动，为完成一个旅游胜地的建设争分夺秒，为国家荣誉做出了巨大牺牲。
"But the report in March in a North Korean state newspaper also revealed the economic dysfunction under Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader. Workers building up the city of Samjiyon, one of Kim’s marquee projects, were “breaking the frozen ground with hammers and chisels and carrying earth with stretchers and gunny sacks,” the report said.",但朝鲜一家官方报纸今年3月的这篇报道，也揭示出朝鲜领导人金正恩领导下的经济失调。报道称，参加三池渊建设的工人们正在“用锤子和凿子砸开冻土，用担架和麻袋运土”。三池渊是金正恩的重点项目之一。
"The report, in the newspaper Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the government, followed South Korean media reports of cases of pneumonia and frostbite in Samjiyon. Together they suggest that U.S.-led sanctions over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program are hurting Kim in a way they haven’t before: by targeting the state-run economy and the party and military elite who support his totalitarian rule.",政府喉舌《劳动新闻》的这篇报道是在韩国媒体报道了三池渊发生肺炎和冻伤病例后刊发的。把这些报道放在一起可看出，以美国为首的针对朝鲜核武器计划的制裁，通过把目标对准国有经济以及支持金正恩极权统治的党和军方精英，给金正恩带来了前所未有的烦恼。
"In that context, North Korea’s test of a “guided tactical weapon” on Thursday might be both a sign of his frustration and a warning to Washington that there will be no progress on nuclear disarmament unless the sanctions are eased.",朝鲜周四“战术制导武器”试验凸显了这一点，专家们认为这是对华盛顿有关制裁的警告。
"For years, the North Korean state has produced coal, iron ore, seafood and textiles for export, mostly to its ally China. Kim and top officials have used this export revenue, as well as the earnings of North Korean workers abroad, to finance nuclear weapons, large projects like Samjiyon and their own privileged lifestyles.",多年来，朝鲜一直把煤炭、铁矿石、海鲜和纺织品等产品用于出口，主要是出口到其盟友中国。金正恩和高级官员利用这些出口收入，以及朝鲜海外工人的收入，为三池渊这样的大型项目以及他们自己的特权生活方式提供资金。
"Previous international sanctions aimed to prevent North Korea from acquiring weapons parts and technology. But the newer ones, imposed in the past few years, ban those lucrative exports, depriving Kim’s regime of its main source of income.",此前的国际制裁以阻止朝鲜获得武器零部件和技术为目的。但过去几年实施的新制裁禁止了这些利润丰厚的出口产品，剥夺了金正恩政权的主要收入来源。
"As a result, party officials, soldiers and police officers who make a living off the state are feeling the effects more sharply than ordinary people who have already learned to fend for themselves through hundreds of unofficial markets, according to defectors and economists.",据脱北者和经济学家说，这些新制裁的结果是，靠政府谋生的党员干部、军人和警察感受到的影响，比普通人更剧烈，因为普通人已学会了通过数百个非官方市场自谋生路。
"“Hardest hit by sanctions are those 20-30% of the population who stay on the government’s socialist payroll and rations,” said Jiro Ishimaru, a Japanese journalist who monitors North Korea with the help of correspondents there. “Enterprising North Koreans can make as much in a day selling vegetables in the market as many military officers can make a month in official wages.”",“受制裁打击最严重的，是那些仍在政府领取社会主义工资和配给的20%至30%的人口，”日本记者石丸次郎(Jiro Ishimaru)说，他在当地通讯员的帮助下跟踪朝鲜的情况。“有创业精神的朝鲜人一天在市场上卖菜赚的钱，和许多军官一个月的官方工资一样多。”
"Five rounds of sanctions have been imposed by the United Nations Security Council since early 2016, when North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test. At the time, China and others argued that the sanctions would disproportionately affect ordinary North Koreans and could backfire.",自2016年初朝鲜进行第四次核试验以来，联合国安全理事会已实施了五轮制裁。当时，中国及其他方面曾声称，这些制裁会集中影响普通朝鲜百姓的生活，可能会事与愿违。
"Instead, the sanctions seem to be having an effect, with Chinese imports from North Korea falling 88% last year. U.S. officials have said that in February, when Kim and President Donald Trump went to Vietnam for their second summit meeting, North Korea asked the United States to lift these last five rounds of sanctions. North Korean officials have said they sought to lift only the sanctions affecting the civilian economy. The two leaders ended the meeting without an agreement, and negotiations have stalled since then.",相反，随着中国从朝鲜的进口去年下降88%，这些制裁似乎正在起作用。美国官员曾表示，当金正恩与特朗普总统2月份前往越南举行第二次峰会时，朝鲜要求美国取消最近五轮的制裁。朝鲜官员曾表示，他们只寻求取消影响民营经济的制裁。两位领导人未达成协议便终止了会谈，谈判自此陷于停顿。
"While the North Korean test this week was most likely a demonstration of a conventional weapons system, it suggested that Kim might resume nuclear and missile tests that he has suspended since November 2017. Earlier this month, he said the United States had until the end of the year to present a new proposal that would lift sanctions on the North.",虽然朝鲜本周的试验基本像是对已有武器体系的宣示，但它表明，金正恩可能会恢复他自2017年11月以来已暂停的核试验和导弹试验。本月早些时候，他曾表示，限美国在今年年底之前拿出一份取消对朝鲜制裁的新方案。
"In the meantime, Kim’s failure to secure sanctions relief has raised the question of how his supporters will respond.",与此同时，金正恩未能促成制裁取消也让人怀疑，他的支持者会如何回应。
"Even before the latest sanctions, monthly wages for the party and military elite were scarcely more than those of ordinary North Koreans. To supplement their state-provided income, they siphoned money from export industries and collected bribes from North Koreans seeking permission to work abroad or smuggle goods from China. Now, that income is drying up.",即使在最新几轮制裁之前，党员和军队干部的月工资也比普通朝鲜人高不了多少。为补贴国家发放的收入，他们从出口行业那里吸金，从寻求获准赴海外工作或从中国走私货物的朝鲜人那里收受贿赂。如今，这些收入正在枯竭。
"Adding to the officers’ humiliation, the sanctions have reduced their rations and forced their wives to help make ends meet as traders in the markets, defectors and economists say.",据脱北者和经济学家称，更令官员们羞愤的是，制裁导致他们的配给减少，迫使他们的妻子在集市上贩卖东西以补贴家用。
The struggles of the elite are a problem for Kim because he has staked his legacy not just on nuclear weapons but on making North Korea a “great socialist economic power.”,权贵阶层的困境对金正恩是个问题，因为他把他政治遗产的赌注不仅押在了核武器上，也押在了让朝鲜变成“伟大的社会主义经济强国”的愿景上。
"“The sanctions make it difficult for Kim Jong Un to execute the visions he has of bringing life into the economy once and for all,” said Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein, a fellow at the Philadelphia-based Foreign Policy Research Institute and editor of North Korean Economy Watch.",“制裁使金正恩难以实现他一举给本国经济注入生命力的愿景，”位于华盛顿的外交政策研究所(Foreign Policy Research Institute)研究员、网络媒体《朝鲜经济观察》(North Korean Economy Watch)编辑本杰明·卡策夫·希尔博斯坦(Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein)说。
"Though Kim still appears to be firmly in power, he could be threatened by unrest among the elites.",金正恩看起来仍牢牢掌握着权力，但他可能会受到权贵阶层躁动的威胁。
"“His biggest worry is that sanctions are squeezing the money flow for the elites, testing their loyalty,” said Joo Sung-ha, a North Korean defector who monitors the North as a journalist based in Seoul. “Losing the uniformed elites’ support means losing the bedrock of his rule.”",“他最大的担忧在于，制裁正在挤压精英们的经济来源，考验着他们的忠诚度，”以记者身份在首尔跟踪朝鲜局势的脱北者朱成夏（Joo Sung-ha，音）说。“失去步调一致的权贵的支持，意味着失去他执政的根基。”
"The state and market systems “are incompatible, given the different prices and wages each comes up with, so that strength in one often means weakness in the other,” said William Brown, a former CIA analyst who follows the North Korean economy.",国有体系和市场体系“互不相容，各自带来的价格和薪资水平皆不相同，因而其中一个的优势往往是另一个的弱势，”密切关注朝鲜经济的前中央情报局(CIA)分析师威廉·布朗(William Brown)说。
"That is apparent in the northeastern town of Musan, once the center of North Korea’s iron-ore production, where many donju investors have gone bankrupt since export routes were closed, said Ishimaru, the Japanese journalist. The miners, meanwhile, have been foraging for herbs to sell in the markets.",这一点在朝鲜北部城市茂山有充分体现。据日本记者石丸次郎称，自出口路径被关闭后，曾一度是朝鲜铁矿石生产中心的这里，有许多富有的投资者已破产。与此同时矿上的工人在寻觅草药拿到市场上卖。
"For now, there is no sign that the economy is reaching a breaking point, according to defectors in touch with their relatives in the North. The prices of rice, corn and fuel remain stable, and the won is holding steady against the U.S. dollar and Chinese yuan. North Korea also continues to conduct trade through illicit ship-to-ship transfers.",据与朝鲜亲戚保持联络的脱北者称，就目前而言，尚无迹象表明经济已濒临崩溃。大米、玉米和燃油价格依然稳定，朝鲜元对美元和人民币的汇率同样保持稳定。朝鲜还在继续通过不正规的船到船货物传送进行着贸易。
"But apartment prices in Pyongyang are declining, and the growing trade deficit with China is depleting North Korea’s foreign currency reserves. That lack of cash could put the government in a bind this summer, when the impact of what U.N. officials called the country’s worst harvest in more than a decade is most likely to be felt.",但平壤的住宅价格正在下降，同中国不断增长的贸易赤字也在耗尽朝鲜的外汇储备。现金的缺乏可能会令政府于今夏陷入困境，届时据联合国官员称为该国十年多来最严重的一次欠收极有可能会产生影响。
"“What he really wants, and needs, is dollars,” Brown said, referring to Kim’s attempt to get the sanctions lifted at the Vietnam meeting. “So he tossed the dice for a big win and lost his bet. I’m pretty sure he will be back for more negotiations soon.”",“他真正想要、急需的，是美元，”布朗说，他指的是金正恩在越南会谈中想要取消制裁的企图。“于是他掷了骰子，想大赢一把，结果赔了赌注。我相当确定，他不久就会回过头来举行更多会谈。”
"LADAKH REGION, India — In front of a tin-roofed house with the Himalaya Mountains rising behind it, about 300 wedding guests waited on a big green lawn, eager for the arrival of the bride and groom.",印度拉达克山区——这是一栋锡皮屋顶的房子，其后是巍峨的喜马拉雅山脉，300多名婚礼宾客聚集在房子前面的绿色草坪上，热切期待着新娘与新郎的到来。
"As the couple appeared, the guests formed a happy scrum around them, whisking them through the doorway and into the house. The rooms smelled of the coming feast: tandoori chicken, salty tea, fresh rolls and succulent goat meat cooked in yogurt and spices.",这对新人终于出现了，客人们欢快地围绕在他们周围，簇拥着他们走过门前的道路，进入房子。屋子里可以闻到香味，盛宴就要上桌了：坦都里烤鸡、咸茶、新鲜肉卷，还有用酸奶和香料烹制的嫩山羊肉。
But the bride’s entire family was conspicuously missing from the party.,但引人瞩目的是，新娘的所有家人都没有出席这场聚会。
"The bride, Stanzin Saldon, is from a Buddhist family, and the groom, Murtaza Agha, is a Muslim. Both grew up in Ladakh, a remote region of Jammu and Kashmir state in India. So what happens around here when a Buddhist woman falls for a Muslim man? Chaos.",新娘斯坦辛·萨尔顿(Stanzin Saldon)来自一个佛教家庭，新郎穆尔塔扎·阿迦(Murtaza Agha)则是穆斯林。拉达克是位于印度查谟和克什米尔邦的一个偏远地区，两人都在这里长大。在这个地方，如果一个信仰佛教的女人爱上一个穆斯林男子会发生什么事？答案就是：混乱。
"The young couple’s romance has spawned protests, shut down businesses, caused fistfights and pitted Muslim and Buddhist leaders against each other. The police have been forced to intervene, and so have the courts.",这对年轻夫妇的恋情引发了抗议活动，导致企业关闭和斗殴事件，令穆斯林和佛教领袖互相攻讦。警方和法院被迫进行干预。
"For several days the two even had to go on the run. They drove around the nearby Kashmir Valley, which is crawling with militants and soldiers, worried sick about being caught together.",两人甚至被迫逃亡了几天。他们开车在附近充斥着武装分子与士兵的克什米尔河谷一带徘徊，担心被人抓到他俩在一起。
"But Saldon, flush with fresh love, would do it all over again. “We found peace in a conflict region,” she said earnestly.",但是，萨尔顿脸上洋溢着爱情的喜悦，就算一切重来一次她也心甘情愿。“我们在一个冲突地区找到了和平，”她热切地说。
"The Buddhist-Muslim divide seems to be getting sharper in this part of the world. Neighboring Bangladesh is struggling to absorb hundreds of thousands of Muslim Rohingyas, an ethnic group from Myanmar, who recently fled atrocities by Myanmar’s military and Buddhist majority.",在这个地方，佛教徒与穆斯林之间的鸿沟似乎越来越深。邻近的孟加拉国正在努力接收数十万来自缅甸的穆斯林罗辛亚人，最近，由于缅甸军人和占多数的佛教徒的暴行，罗辛亚族人开始逃离那个国家。
"But to Saldon, 30, and Agha, 32, none of this mattered.",但是对于30岁的萨尔顿和32岁的阿迦来说，这一切都不重要。
"Theirs is a Ladakh love affair, through and through. They met on a college trekking trip to the Himalayas. They kept in touch. Agha, a government engineer, and Saldon, a social worker, both lived in the city of Jammu, south of Ladakh, and they couldn’t stop calling each other for coffee and lunch. Saldon said she could feel herself falling in love with the soft-spoken and gentle-mannered Agha. But she kept it a secret.",这是一桩拉达克恋情，从一开始就是如此。他俩在大学组织的一次喜马拉雅山徒步旅行中相遇。之后就一直保持联系。阿迦是工程师，在政府部门工作，萨尔顿则是社会工作者，两人都住在拉达克南部的查谟市，他们情不自禁地总是给对方打电话，约对方出来喝咖啡、吃午饭。萨尔顿说，她可以感觉到自己爱上了柔声细语、性情温和的阿迦。但她一直保守着这个秘密。
"After she was nearly killed in a rickshaw accident, though, she recalled, “It was Murtaza’s face that floated before my eyes. I decided life was too short and I should confess my love.”",后来她遭遇了一场三轮车车祸，差点死去，但她回忆说：“那个时候，穆尔塔扎的面孔浮现在我眼前。我觉得人生苦短，我应该坦白自己的爱。”
"Agha, who grew up in Kargil, couldn’t have been happier.",在格尔吉尔长大的阿迦知道后高兴极了。
"But when he told his family he wanted to marry a Buddhist girl from Leh, his father’s response was: Impossible.",但是当他告诉家人，自己想娶一个来自列城的佛教女孩时，父亲的回答是：不可能。
“Why marry a Leh girl?” his family kept asking. There were so many more Muslim options.,“为什么要娶一个列城女孩？”他的家人一直追问。明明有那么多穆斯林女孩可供选择。
"In July 2016, with help from one of Agha’s uncles, the couple held a very small private wedding under a clear blue sky by one of Kargil’s sparkling mountain streams.",2016年7月，在阿迦一个叔叔的帮助下，这对夫妇在格尔吉尔清澈的蓝天之下，在一条波光粼粼的山间小溪旁边，举行了一场非常小的秘密婚礼。
"Then they went back to their jobs, the world oblivious to their relationship. They maintained separate homes, planning to one day unite.",然后他们就回去工作了，整个世界都没有注意到他们的关系。他们维持着各自的家，计划总有一天能搬到一起。
"But soon their family members found out. While Agha’s people took it in stride, Saldon’s went berserk. They pulled her out of Jammu and locked her in the family home in Leh. Her father spat in her face, and later called on shamans to perform ceremonies to try to make her forget about Agha, she said.",但双方家人不久后就发现了他们的关系。阿迦的家人最终宽容地对待了这件事，萨尔顿的家人却狂怒不已。他们把她从查谟带回来，锁在列城的家里。她说，她的父亲冲她脸上吐口水，后来又找萨满举行仪式，试图让她忘记阿迦。
"Saldon said she lost 20 pounds. She was heartsick to be away from Agha and terrified of her father, who kept screaming at her.",萨尔顿说她体重减轻了20磅。离开阿迦让她伤心欲绝，她也害怕父亲，他一直在冲她尖叫。
"“I was totally cut off from the outside world,” she said. “I feared death as my father shouted, ‘Why did you not die no sooner than you were born?”’",“我被彻底同外界隔绝，”她说。“我父亲大叫，‘你为什么没有一生下来就死掉？’让我怕得要命。”
"One morning she sneaked out. She knew her family would chase her, so she went to court and won a restraining order demanding that they leave her alone.",一天早晨，她逃了出来。她知道家人会追捕她，所以去法庭申请了禁制令，要求他们远离她。
"But the problem was bigger than her family now, and things in Leh were about to get sticky.",但是现在的问题已经远不止于她的家人，列城的局面也开始变得棘手起来。
"The Buddhist community association was so outraged by the relationship, and the fact that Saldon had fled, that it sent young men stomping through Leh’s main bazaar, demanding that all the shopkeepers help bring her back. Buddhist toughs threatened taxi drivers and merchants from Kargil, telling them they weren’t allowed to work in Leh. A few men got into fistfights — all over a couple most of them didn’t even know.",佛教社区协会对他们的恋情感到愤怒，萨尔顿的逃跑刺激一些年轻男人冲进列城的主要集市，要求所有的店主都帮忙把她找回来。佛教暴徒威胁来自格尔吉尔的出租车司机和商人，告诉他们不许在列城工作。有些男人互相斗殴——这一切都是为了一对大多数人根本就不认识的情侣。
"Harsh Malhotra, chief coordinator for the Love Commandos, a voluntary Indian organization that helps couples fight off arranged marriages and deal with harassment from their families, said this case was getting attention across the country. But he wasn’t surprised.",“爱情突击队”(Love Commandos)是印度的一个志愿者组织，专门帮助情侣反抗包办婚姻，并处理双方家人的骚扰，其首席协调员哈什·马尔霍特拉(Harsh Malhotra)表示，这一案例吸引了全国各地的关注。但他并不对此感到惊讶。
"“Just as the Ganges flows freely, so, too, lovers of any caste, creed and sect,” he said.",“正如恒河自由自在地流淌，任何种姓、信仰与教派的恋人也会自由自在地相爱，”他说。
"This Ladakhi version of Romeo and Juliet was easy to politicize, he said, because the couple came from middle-class backgrounds and were perfect fodder for “those who consider themselves to be the self-appointed guardians of culture and society.”",他说，这对拉达克的罗密欧与朱丽叶很容易被政治化，因为他们有着中产阶级背景，为那些“自封为文化与社会的捍卫者们”提供了完美的靶子。
Leh has since calmed down. But the episode has put a little extra steam in the quest by some of Leh’s Buddhists to get more autonomy for the Ladakh region.,列城已经平静下来。但是，列城有一些佛教徒一直在谋求为拉达克地区争取更多的自治权，这场风波为他们增添了更多动力。
"As for the couple, they seem to have weathered this unscathed. She is hoping her parents will come around someday soon and welcome her and her husband with a hug.",至于这对夫妻，他们似乎毫发无损地度过了困境。萨尔顿希望父母能在不久的将来回心转意，用拥抱迎接她和她的丈夫。
"Catherine Chen was sitting in a pew at St. John Vianney Roman Catholic Church in Flushing, Queens, practicing. It was mid-April and she had just completed a run-through of what to do when the priest pours the Holy Water on her head later in the month. Fifty or so other Chinese catechumens — people who are joining the Catholic faith — accompanied by their sponsors, sat in the pews around her, listening to the instructions delivered from the altar.",凯瑟琳·陈(Catherine Chen)正坐在皇后区法拉盛的圣耀汗维亚内罗马天主教堂(St. John Vianney Roman Catholic Church)的长椅上练习。时值四月中旬，她刚刚完成的排练是，当神父在这个月晚些时候把圣水浇在她头上时，她该怎么做。约50名其他将加入天主教的华人新信徒在引领人的陪同下坐在她周围，听从祭坛上发出的指示。
This was their only rehearsal for the Easter Vigil.,这是他们为复活节守夜所做的唯一一次排练。
"“I think I might screw up,” she said in a low whisper. “I just hope I do well.”",“我担心自己可能会做错，”她低声说。“我只希望我做得好。”
"Across the country each year, more than 30,000 people officially join the Catholic Church on Easter Eve — a tradition that dates back to the early days of the church — by participating in the sacraments of initiation: baptism, holy communion and confirmation.",每年，全美国有3万多人在复活节前夕正式加入天主教会，这个复活节的传统可以追溯到天主教成立之初。新信徒需要参加由圣洗、领受圣餐和坚振组成的入教圣礼。
"Of the 500 or so converting in New York this weekend, about a third are Chinese immigrants, some of whom are seeking asylum based on religious persecution in China. Most of the Chinese immigrants live in Brooklyn and Queens, and they are having a transformative effect on local Catholic churches.",本周末在纽约皈依基督教的约500人中，约三分之一是中国移民，其中一些是因为在中国受到宗教迫害的寻求庇护者。大多数中国移民居住在布鲁克林和皇后区，他们正在给当地的天主教会带来变革性的影响。
"State control over religion remains strong in China, which has been known to monitor churches threateningly, if not raze some of them entirely, while harassing and sometimes imprisoning pastors and priests. Christians in particular faced severe persecution in 2018, the worst registered in 40 years, according to an annual report by ChinaAid, a Christian nonprofit.",中国政府对宗教保持着强有力的控制。大家知道中国政府用恐吓手段监控教会的情况，即使不是把它们彻底摧毁，也时常会骚扰甚至监禁牧师和神父。据基督教非营利组织“对华援助协会”(ChinaAid)的年度报告，中国基督徒在2018年面临的迫害尤为严重，是40年来最糟糕的。
"That said, religion is on the rise in China. Tens of millions now identify as Christians. Protestantism has swelled to what some believe to be as many as 115 million adherents, while Catholics represent a smaller group, with approximately 10 million.",尽管如此，中国信教的人数正在增长。目前有数千万人自认为是基督徒。按照某种估计，新教信徒人数已多达1.15亿，天主教徒的人数要少些，约为1000万。
These numbers have trickled down to immigrant communities in New York.,这些数字已经渐渐影响到纽约的移民社区。
"“As more and more Chinese immigrants come to America, we see our parish get bigger each year,” said Sister Monica Gan, who runs the initiations at St. John Vianney. The process, developed by the Catholic church, teaches the tenets of Christianity and Catholicism to those who want to convert, like Ms. Chen.",“随着越来越多的中国移民来美国，我们看到教区的人数每年都在增长，”甘曼妮修女(Sister Monica Gan)说，她负责圣耀汗维亚内堂的入教启蒙。入教启蒙是天主教会为陈女士这样想皈依的人传授基督教和天主教教义而设置的。
"In the early 1990s in Brooklyn, Father Norman Bennett, then a priest at Our Lady of Perpetual Help, in Sunset Park, recognized an opportunity to connect with Chinese immigrants who were steadily moving into the neighborhood. At the time, the majority of immigrants were Cantonese speakers, so Father Bennett started studying the language. It was the Sunday after Christmas, in 1995, when Father Bennett delivered Brooklyn’s first Mass in Chinese. About 25 people showed up.",20世纪90年代初，当时在布鲁克林日落公园(Sunset Park)的永助圣母堂(Our Lady of Perpetual Help)担任神父的诺曼·班内特(Norman Bennett)意识到了与中国移民建立联系的机会，这些移民正在逐渐搬入该社区。当时，大多数移民讲的是粤语，所以班内特开始学习粤语。1995年圣诞节后的那个礼拜日，班内特做了布鲁克林的首次中文弥撒。大约有25人到场。
"“I was very nervous and overwhelmed,” Father Bennett recalled. “My pronunciation wasn’t that good, and I was barely able to get through it all.”",“我非常紧张，有点不知所措，”班内特回忆道。“我的发音不是很好，勉勉强强做完了弥撒。”
"Now, more than two decades later, at least four churches in Brooklyn offer Mandarin and/or Cantonese services. Three of those offer Christian initiation programs in Mandarin. Our Lady of Perpetual Help has seen the greatest increase in those converting to Catholicism, with a nearly 160 percent jump in five years, according to records from the Diocese of Brooklyn.",20多年后的今天，布鲁克林至少有四所教堂提供普通话和粤语，或其中一种语言的服务。其中三所教堂提供普通话的基督徒入教课程。据布鲁克林主教辖区的记录，永助圣母堂皈依天主教的人数出现了最大增长，五年近160%。
"Local churches are simply adjusting to changing demographics, said Father Thomas Gaunt, executive director of the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown University, an independent research group that studies the Catholic Church. “In neighborhoods like Brooklyn, people leave, but churches don’t,” he said. “Parishes there are trying to respond to the needs of the community.”",乔治城大学使徒应用研究中心(Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown University)执行主任托马斯·冈特(Thomas Gaunt)神父说，当地的教会只不过是在适应不断变化的人口结构。该中心是一个研究天主教会的独立机构。“在布鲁克林这样的社区，人会搬走，但教堂不会，”他说。“那里的教区正努力满足社区的需求。”
"Churches in Queens are adapting in a similar way. After years without a religious home, Chinese Catholics in the Flushing area settled at St. John Vianney in 2006. Now, daily Masses are celebrated there in Mandarin, with a Sunday morning Mass that is celebrated in both Mandarin and Cantonese. Five Christian initiation classes, taught in Mandarin, take place every week.",皇后区的教堂也在进行类似的调整。法拉盛地区的中国天主教徒多年来一直没有固定的礼拜场所，2006年，他们在圣耀汗维亚内堂安顿下来。现在，那里每天都有用普通话做的弥撒，周日上午有用普通话和粤语做的弥撒。每周有五个用普通话授课的基督教启蒙班。
"Ms. Chen made the decision to convert this past fall, after a friend persuaded her to attend Mass. Born in Fujian Province and now a permanent resident, Ms. Chen moved to Flushing 10 years ago, when she was 14. She wasn’t raised in a religious household, and she didn’t know what to expect.",去年秋天，经一位朋友的劝说参加了弥撒之后，陈女士做出了皈依的决定。她出生在福建省，现在是美国永久居民，10年前14岁时来到了法拉盛。她不是在信教家庭长大的，也不知道宗教是怎么回事。
"Together, they went to St John Vianney. “I never felt like that before,” Ms. Chen said. “I just started to believe that God really does exist.”",她和朋友一起去了圣耀汗维亚内堂。“我以前从未有过那种感觉，”陈女士说。“我开始相信上帝真的存在了。”
"Many of Ms. Chen’s classmates, however, particularly those who are recent arrivals from China, did not have such an open and accepting experience practicing Catholicism before starting the Christian initiation program in Queens. They described repressed lives in China, often spent in the shadows and attending underground churches, keeping their faith a secret to all but a select few.",不过，陈女士的许多同学，尤其是那些刚从中国来的同学，在皇后区开始基督教入教课程之前，在天主教信仰方面没有这种开放和被接受的经历。他们描述了在中国受压制的生活，经常只能暗地里参加地下教会的活动，在保密的情况下坚守信仰，除少数人外不让别人知道。
"Catherine Zhang came to the United States about a year ago from the Henan Province with her husband, Simon, to seek asylum, claiming religious persecution. Ms. Zhang, who spoke through a translator, said that she had been arrested in 2017 and held in police detention for participating in an “illegal religious activity,” what she described as a prayer and Bible study group.",大约一年前，凯瑟琳·张(Catherine Zhang)和丈夫西蒙(Simon)从河南省来到美国，以受到宗教迫害为由寻求庇护。她通过翻译说，自己曾在2017年因参加“非法宗教活动”遭到逮捕并被警方拘留，她说她参加的是一个祈祷和圣经学习小组。
"On Easter Eve, the Zhangs will undergo the sacraments of initiation.",这对夫妇将在复活节前夕参加入教圣礼。
"“Spiritually speaking, I am free,” Ms. Zhang said. “I am obtaining spiritual growth, and it is definitely worth it.”",“从心灵上来说，我是自由的，”张女士说。“我正在获得心灵上的成长，这绝对值得。”
"Last summer, an immigrant named Daniel, who asked that his last name not be used for legal reasons and also spoke through a translator, started to take Christian initiation classes at Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Brooklyn, when he wasn’t working as a dishwasher in a restaurant.",去年夏天，一个名叫丹尼尔(Daniel)的移民利用在餐馆里洗碗打工的闲暇，开始在布鲁克林的永助圣母堂上基督教启蒙课。出于法律原因，丹尼尔要求记者不要提及他的姓，对他的采访也是通过翻译进行的。
"He came to the country illegally, saying his “religious situation” in China threatened his mental health and strained his economic livelihood.",他非法来到美国，说他在中国的“宗教情况”让自己的精神健康受到威胁，经济上也难以为继。
"But stories like Daniel’s and Ms. Zhang’s led to a sweeping investigation by federal authorities that, in 2012, resulted in charges against at least 30 people of running an asylum mill in Flushing and in Chinatown. The mill coached clients to make up stories about religious persecution, among other fabricated claims, in order to win asylum. The cases of 13,500 immigrants, many of whom are Chinese, are currently under review, with threat of deportation.",但是，像丹尼尔和张女士这样的故事使得联邦当局做了一个全面调查。结果，在2012年，至少30人遭到起诉，他们被控在法拉盛和唐人街运作一个伪造庇护的工厂。为了获得庇护，这些人指导客户编造宗教迫害等虚假故事。目前有13500名移民（其中许多是中国人）的案件正在受到审查，他们面临着驱逐出境的威胁。
"“There is no evidence that recent Chinese Catholics in our diocese are not true believers and are just turning to us to help support their asylum applications,” said Adriana Rodriguez, of the Diocese of Brooklyn. “The Catholic Church has an extensive period of initiation and commitment,” she continued, arguing that those interested in immigration status only could opt for a “Christian church with a shorter period of conversion.”",“没有证据表明，我们教区最近的中国天主教徒不是真正的信徒，只是为了得到对他们庇护申请的支持，才向我们寻求帮助的，”布鲁克林教区的阿德里亚娜·罗德里格斯(Adriana Rodriguez)说。“入教和献身天主教会需要很长的时间，”她接着说。她认为，那些对移民身份感兴趣的人只会选择“皈依期较短的基督教会”。
"Daniel, who is currently seeking asylum, seems to have no problem with the lengthy process, along with its rituals. Though he was raised Catholic, he was never baptized. His baptism on Saturday marks more than just his official entry to the church; it symbolizes a new chapter.",正在寻求庇护的丹尼尔看来不在乎漫长的皈依过程及有关的礼仪。虽然他从小就是天主教徒，但从未受过洗礼。周六的洗礼不仅标志着他正式加入天主教，而且象征着生活的新篇章。
"“I wanted to start a new life here,” he said, “and by being baptized, I will be reborn.”",“我想在这里开始新的生活，”他说，“通过受洗，我将获得重生。”
"On Easter Sunday in Sri Lanka, coordinated bombings targeted churches, hotels and other sites, killing more than 200 people and wounding hundreds of others.",在周日复活节当天，斯里兰卡发生了针对教堂、酒店及其他地点的有组织的爆炸，造成200多人死亡、数百人受伤。
"The attacks in Sri Lanka, an island nation in the Indian Ocean, is the largest carried out on South Asian Christians in recent memory.",针对印度洋岛国斯里兰卡的这一连串袭击，是近些年对南亚基督徒实施的最大规模的袭击。
What we know about the attacks,关于袭击，我们已经知道的情况
"• The explosions began around 8:45 a.m. on Sunday, and the deadliest appeared to be at St. Sebastian’s Church in Negombo. The other churches attacked were St. Anthony’s Shrine in Colombo and Zion Church in Batticaloa. There were also explosions Sunday morning at three hotels in the capital city of Colombo: the Shangri-La, the Cinnamon Grand and the Kingsbury.",•	爆炸始于周日上午8点45分左右，死亡人数最多的似乎是尼甘布的圣塞巴斯蒂安教堂(St. Sebastian’s Church)。另两座遭到袭击的教堂包括科伦坡的圣安东尼圣堂(St. Anthony’s Shrine)和拜蒂克洛的锡安教堂(Zion Church)。周日上午，首都科伦坡的三家酒店也发生了爆炸：香格里拉(Shangri-La)、肉桂大酒店(Cinnamon Grand)和金斯伯里酒店(Kingsbury)。
"• More explosions followed in the afternoon, all in Colombo. The first was at the Tropical Inn, a small hotel not far from the national zoo in the suburb of Dehiwala. There was also at least one explosion at a housing complex in another suburb, Dematagoda.",•	下午又发生了更多起爆炸，全都在科伦坡。第一起是在郊区德希瓦拉的国家动物园附近一间名为热带旅馆(Tropical Inn)的小酒店。在郊区德马塔戈达的一片住宅区也发生了至少一起爆炸。
"• At least 207 people were killed and at least 450 wounded in the day’s attacks, the police said. At least 35 of the dead were foreigners, several of them American, the authorities said.

"• A top Sri Lankan police official issued a letter on April 11 to government security officials warning of possible suicide attacks at Catholic churches by a radical Islamist group, National Thowheeth Jama’ath. It was unclear what safeguards, if any, were taken, or whether in the end the group played any role in the violence on Sunday.",•	4月11日，斯里兰卡一名高级警官曾致信政府安全官员，警告天主教堂可能会遭到极端伊斯兰组织NTJ (National Thowheeth Jama'ath)的自杀式袭击。尚不清楚政府采取了怎样的防护措施——如果有的话，或该组织是否最终参与了周日的暴力袭击。

"Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, will meet with Vladimir V. Putin of Russia later this month, the first summit since Mr. Kim took power in 2011. Mr. Kim’s travels to Russia come as negotiations over nuclear disarmament deteriorate with the United States.",本月晚些时候，朝鲜领导人金正恩将与俄罗斯领导人弗拉基米尔·V·普京会面，这是他2011年上台以来两人首次举行峰会。金正恩此次俄罗斯之旅正值朝美核裁军谈判局面日渐恶化。
"My phone is my favorite possession. I wish I could pretend it has been some torrid courtship, that after much cat-and-mousing the two of us succumbed to our mutual attraction and decided to settle down and make an honest go of it, but I can’t: I am in breathless pursuit, hustling to keep her updated and paid for, wooing her with expensive protective cases and as many off-brand charging cords as there are outlets in my home. She acknowledges this attention with occasional notifications, blinking on the screen, reminders to update, so many needs. That makes me want her even more.",我的手机是我最喜欢的东西。真希望可以假装我们之间有一段炽烈的求爱期，经过多次猫鼠游戏之后，我们两都屈服于彼此的吸引力，决定确定关系，真诚地相处，但我做不到：我正处于一种令人窒息的追求中，我忙着让她保持更新并不欠费、用昂贵的保护壳和许许多多杂牌充电线讨好她——我家有多少插座，就有多少线。她则通过许多的需求——偶尔的通知、屏幕上的闪烁、更新提醒——来告诉我，她知道我在惦着她。这让我更想要她。
"I know that having her carelessly bouncing around the bottom of my bag all day and on the nightstand inches from my sleeping face, readily available for when I need to look up “recipes for morons” or “the best way to wash a cat,” is putting my precious information at risk. My phone is always listening, and through a series of bloops and bleeps I do not understand, the data I have spewed into the universe gets sold and fed back to me in a targeted Instagram ad for whatever it is I now urgently need.",我知道，让她整天在我包里随意地蹦蹦跳跳，把她放在床头柜距离我睡觉的脸几英寸的地方，让我随时可以查找“傻瓜菜谱”或“给猫洗澡最好的方法”，是将我珍贵的信息置于危险之中。我的手机一直在聆听，通过一系列我不理解的杂音和哔哔声，我释出到这宇宙的数据被卖掉，然后以一则定向的Instagram广告反馈回给我，无论我现在迫切需要的是什么。
"I don’t know how thrilled I am to be giving up my secrets, but it’s foolish to think I have any control over them, and ultimately I don’t care. I love convenience and entertainment too much to worry about how much information I cannot control is being leaked to marketers, retailers, the government and whatever Chinese intelligence agency controls the barrage of ads for $13 dresses that saturate my feed.",我不知道我到底有多乐意将自己的秘密拱手让出，但傻子才会认为这是个我能左右的过程，况且说到底我也不在乎。我太爱便利和娱乐了，以至于无暇担心有多少我不能控制的信息被泄露给了营销商、零售商、政府或是不知道哪个中国情报机构，是它们在控制那些对我的时间线狂轰滥炸的13美元裙子广告。
Maybe it’s because I got in the smartphone game late and have a real memory of how inconvenient life used to be.,也许是因为我太晚才进入智能手机这场游戏，所以还能真切地回忆起过去的生活有多不方便。
"I’m staring down the barrel of my 40th year, and the first computer I bought for myself was six or seven years ago. I didn’t get my first iPhone until they’d been around for years, partly because I was like: “Who needs that? I prefer to live in the real world!” but mostly because the idea of walking around with a $500 computer in my pocket seemed dangerous. And the idea that I could somehow scrape together the money to purchase said pocket computer while also maintaining a roof over my head (read: partying all the time and paying for cable) was hilarious and unrealistic. I was the last dinosaur at the club sending multi-tap texts on a Nokia E51 with no camera.",我在40岁的时候才开始冒这个险，我给自己买第一台电脑是六七年前的事。我在iPhone面世好几年以后才开始用它，部分原因是我觉得：“谁需要这玩意儿？我更喜欢生活在真实的世界里！”但最主要的原因是，口袋里揣着一台500美元的电脑到处走似乎很危险。凑钱买下这台所谓的袖珍电脑，同时还能保持个温饱（即：整天出去狂欢，付有线电视费)，这样的想法既可笑又不切实际。我是夜店里最后一个在用无摄像头诺基亚E51多点击输入法发短信的恐龙。
"When I finally upgraded, I didn’t get what all the fuss was about. O.K., sure, this glowing rectangle in my bag can tell me the weather anywhere in the world at this exact moment, but who cares? Wait, it can also figure out exactly what wrong street I’m turning down and steer me back in the right direction? And it counted how many steps I took? While also storing all the passwords I can never remember? Please excuse me while I build this shrine to the new most important thing in my life.",最后我终于升级了，但我不明白这东西有什么了不得的。是，我包里这个发光的长方形可以告诉我眼下世界上任何地方的天气，那又怎么样？等等，它还能准确地知道我在哪条街上拐错了弯，然后引导我回到正确的方向？它计算了我走了多少步？还储存了所有我永远记不住的密码？不好意思，我一下子就为生命中这个最重要的新事物建起了圣殿。
"That is how it gets you. I was a skeptic and then I was a convert almost immediately. I have long understood that I am a tiny, powerless cog in the wheel of modern America, plus I’m not a hacker, so what do I even know about keeping things hidden? Is it even possible for me, a regular person who cannot figure out how to program the television remote, to circumvent the eyes of all of the faceless technology corporations analyzing my information? What am I going to do, cheat Amazon? Outsmart Google? No, I’m going to do what everyone else does: enter my credit card information when prompted and get that thing I need two days from when I decided I needed it.",它就是这么征服你的。我是一个怀疑论者，然后我几乎立刻就皈依了。我早就明白，我只是现代美国车轮上一颗无力的小小螺丝钉，而且我不是什么黑客，我怎么可能知道怎么把东西藏起来？我只是一个连怎么设置电视遥控器都不会的普通人，难道我能避开所有那些无形的科技公司分析我个人信息的眼睛吗？我该怎么办，骗过亚马逊？智胜谷歌？不，我要做其他人都做的事情：在手机给出提示时输入我的信用卡信息，并且在两天后得到我认为我需要的东西。
"A few months ago I went to dinner with the kind of people whose idea of fun is to correct your pronunciation of “niçoise,” and they boldly suggested that we all put our phones face down in the center of the table for the entirety of the meal and what felt like a needlessly lingering discussion afterward.",几个月前，我和一些人共进晚餐，他们是那种喜欢在你点尼斯沙拉的时候纠正你发音的人，他们大胆地提出建议，我们吃饭时应该把手机屏幕朝下放在桌子中央，随后的感觉就像是一个毫无必要，但又挥之不去的话题。
"Now, I didn’t die. But I also didn’t know what time it was. Or if anyone had texted me. And I’m not really a “post a picture of my fancy meal” kind of person, but I could tell that other people wanted to. The air was heavy with missed opportunity. And you know what we talked about while cringing internally as the carafe of still water we actually had to pay for came perilously close to splashing on our helpless devices every time it was passed?",没看手机，我也没死。但我不知道现在几点了，也不知道有没有人给我发短信。我并不是那种总会发“我的美妙大餐”照片的人，但我敢说其他人想这么干。空气中弥漫着错失良机的遗憾。我们一边聊天，一边在心里担心不已，因为侍者每次用玻璃瓶送上我们还得为之买单的水，情况都显得非常危险，水珠好像就要溅到我们无助的设备上了，谁还在乎聊了什么呢。
"TV shows, which you can watch on a phone. Books, which, if your eyes haven’t already burned through the back of your skull from being on your phone all the time, you can read on your phone. Murder podcasts, which are specifically made to be listened to on a phone.",电视节目可以在手机上看。书也可以在手机上看——如果你还没有因为一直盯着手机，觉得眼睛深处阵阵灼痛。还有谋杀案播客，它就是专门在手机上收听的。
"[As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel’s limited-run newsletterSign up for Charlie Warzel’s limited-run newsletter to explore what’s at stake and what you can do about it.]",随着科技的进步，它会继续模糊公共和私人之间的界限吗？订阅查理·沃泽尔(Charlie Warzel)限时推出的时事通讯，探索其中的利害关系以及你能做些什么。
"Yes, your phone is potentially hazardous to whatever semblance of security you might have. Yes, there are many medical professionals who would attest to the deleterious effect modern technology has on the brains and interpersonal skills of adults. But hear me out: Maybe it’s worth it?",是的，手机可能会对你的安全构成潜在威胁。是的，有许多医学专家可以证明现代技术对成年人的大脑和人际交往能力会产生有害的影响。但是听我说：这也许是值得的？
"My phone knows so much about me. It knows where I am, how many steps I took to get there, the whisper of a thought I don’t remember even fully forming in my brain that somehow made its way to a search engine. It also knows I am addicted, which is why it doesn’t ever really have to worry about whether I’m creeped out by the digital eyes I can feel looking over my shoulder.",我的手机知道很多关于我的事。它知道我在哪里，知道我走了多少步才走到那里，它知道我的某个小念头在何时进入了搜索引擎，而我自己根本不记得它是什么时候在我脑海里形成的 。它也知道我上瘾了，所以它从来没有真正担心过我会不会被我一回头就能感觉到的数字眼睛吓住。
"Not long ago, Apple put a screen-time feature on the iPhone that’s supposed to, I don’t know, shame me into putting down the drug it won’t stop selling me. I use the statistics it collects as a challenge to spend even more time messing around on my phone. Only one hour and 37 minutes of social networking yesterday, you say? Let me put this informative book I was reading down and try to top that. But my phone already knows that’s what I’d want to do.",不久前，苹果公司在iPhone上添加了一个屏幕使用时间功能，我说不好，这可能是在羞辱我没能戒掉这种它根本没有停止向我出售的药物。我把它收集的数据当成一种挑战，花更多的时间在手机上到处乱看。你说我昨天只用了1小时37分钟看社交网络？让我把手头这本信息量很大的书放下来，试着打破这个记录。但我的手机已经知道我想要做什么。

"Kilometer Zero: Notre-Dame de Paris, the place from which distance in France is measured, the reference of a people, the starting point and endpoint, the “epicenter,” as President Emmanuel Macron put it. That is why so many people, religious or not, were in tears as the great cathedral burned. A part of themselves, their bearings, was aflame.",零公里：巴黎圣母院，法国距离丈量的零点，一个民族的参照点，是起点也是终点，是法国总统马纽埃尔·马克龙(Emmanuel Macron)所说的“中心”。这就是为什么当这座大教堂失火时，那么多人——无论是否是教徒——都在流泪。他们自身的一部分，他们的坐标，正在焚毁。
"Ransacked during the revolution in an anticlerical frenzy, restored and rebuilt during the 19th century after tempers cooled, site of imperial coronation, national liberation and presidential funerals, Notre-Dame became the nation’s soul, the place where France could reconcile its turbulent history, the monarchical and the republican, the religious and the secular.",法国大革命期间，巴黎圣母院在一场反对教权主义的狂热中遭到洗劫；到了19世纪，愤怒已经冷却，经过修复重建，它成为了举行帝王加冕典礼、民族解放运动和总统葬礼的场所，成为了这个国家的灵魂，成为法国与其动荡历史、君主制与共和制、宗教与世俗实现和解的地方。
"The centuries proved ecumenical. Time made the cathedral everyone’s, in France and beyond France. “A mine of memories,” said Claire Illouz, an artist born and raised in Paris. “For us all.”",几个世纪的光阴，证明了它的普世意义。无论是在法国还是法国之外，时间让它成为了每个人的大教堂。“我们所有人的一座记忆之矿，”在巴黎出生和长大的艺术家克莱尔·伊卢兹(Claire Illouz)说。
"What is Paris after all? Beauty. The horror of it lay in watching beauty burn, the delicate spire toppling into an inferno of 800-year-old beams. Here was the best of humankind, as powerful an expression as exists of the sacred, going up in black smoke.",巴黎究竟是什么？是美。它的恐怖之处在于看着美丽燃烧，精致的塔尖倒在800年历史的横梁构成的火海里。这是集人类之大成者，如同神圣存在般强大的表达，在黑烟中化为灰烬。
"The loss of human life is terrible to behold, but the destruction of beauty may be no less so. In a time of anxiety, of ugliness and hatred and lies, the blaze felt ominous. “Beauty is truth, truth beauty,” John Keats wrote, and that is “all ye need to know.”",人类生命的丧失是可怕的，但美的毁灭也许同样可怕。在一个充满焦虑、丑陋、仇恨和谎言的时代，这场大火让人感受到了不祥。“美即真理，真理即美，”约翰·济慈(John Keats)写道，“知道这个就够了。”
"A friend in Paris, Sarah Cleveland, wrote to me: “It was strangely quiet and still, as if people were in a trance, watching the fire boil inside the shell of the cathedral walls, like a caldron. The scene was solemn, reverent. Hopeless. It seemed impossible that something so monumental could be so fragile.”",我的巴黎朋友萨拉·克利夫兰(Sarah Cleveland)给我写信说：“静得出奇，人们仿佛陷入了恍惚，看着火焰在大教堂墙内沸腾，像一口大锅。场面庄严肃穆。还有绝望。如此具有纪念意义的东西竟然如此脆弱。”
"Civilization is fragile. Democracy is fragile, like that spire. It is impossible today, it is dangerous, to ignore that. When a universal reference goes up in smoke, an abyss opens up.",文明是脆弱的。民主是脆弱的，就像那个尖顶。今天，对此视而不见是不可能的，也是危险的。当一个普世参照物化为乌有时，一个深渊就打开了。
"I remember the cool of the immense interior, now open to the sky, during the summer of 1976, the first I lived in Paris. There was a heat wave. Rivers were reduced to a trickle, fountains dry, stores emptied of bottled water. People sat in the pews, stunned. Some prayed. Children played. The young and the old, the innocent and the wise, were gathered. Blue light filtered through the magnificent stained-glass rose windows above the portals. The air smelt of stone and candle wax.",我还记得1976年夏天，我第一次住在巴黎的时候，教堂那如今已经向天空敞开的庞大内室是凉飕飕的。当时有热浪来袭。河流变成了涓涓细流，喷泉干涸，商店里的瓶装水销售一空。人们坐在教堂里的长椅上发愣。有人在祈祷。孩童在玩耍。后辈与长辈，愚者与智者，聚在一起。蓝色的光线透过入口上方华丽的彩色玻璃窗射了进来。空气中有石头和烛蜡的气息。
"The holiness struck me as inclusive. Notre-Dame is a sanctuary, in a time when the American president spits on sanctuaries and has considered, as punishment, dumping poor migrants in those cities that dare to call themselves by that name.",那神圣给我的感觉是一种包容。巴黎圣母院是一个庇护所，而在这个时代，美国总统在唾弃庇护之所，并考虑将贫困的移民丢给那些敢于自称庇护所的城市作为惩罚。
"The half-lit cathedral I first saw as a young man allowed for human error, like those revolutionaries after 1789 lopping the stone heads off biblical kings they mistakenly took to be French. In time the children playing in the transept would be mine. Two of them were born in Paris, city of gilt and gravel, its islands pointing their prows to the bridges, its arteries anchored by Notre-Dame; the cathedral always there across the Seine, reassuring, its facade as solemn as the twin bell towers, its flanks fanciful as the flying buttresses and gargoyles, monumental from any angle whatsoever.",我在青年时代第一次看到的这座昏暗大教堂，是体谅人类犯下的错误的，比如1789年之后的那些革命者，他们误以为那些圣经中的国王是法国国王，于是砍掉了雕像的头颅。光阴荏苒，我的孩子们在圣母院的耳堂里玩耍。其中两个出生在巴黎，这座流光溢彩的砾石之城，它的小岛像一艘艘驶向桥梁的船，它的主干道由巴黎圣母院来锚定；这座大教堂总是在塞纳河的对岸，让人安心，它的外立面跟两座钟楼一样庄严，侧面像拱扶垛和滴水兽一样奇幻，不管从哪个角度看，它都赫然耸立在眼前。
"Our Lady of Paris is still there after the blaze, with her towers, roofless now. President Macron vowed to rebuild the cathedral. Money is pouring in. The French president was dignified, a reminder of the unifying power of dignity at a time when it has vanished from the White House.",大火过后，我们的巴黎女士还在那里，她的塔楼已经没有了屋顶。马克龙总统发誓要重建大教堂。资金大量涌来。这位法国总统举止尊严，当这种尊严已从白宫消失之际，他提醒人们，尊严还具有令人们团结起来的力量。
"Notre-Dame, Macron said, is “our history” and “our imaginary”: a means, in other words, to remember and an inspiration to all who aspire for something transcendent, beyond self. The contribution of President Trump, for whom self is all, was to suggest sending “flying water tankers” to douse the cathedral. His advice was ignored.",马克龙说，巴黎圣母院是“我们的历史”和“我们的想象”，换言之，它是一种记忆的方式，激励着所有追求某种超越的人。视自己为一切的特朗普总统的贡献是建议派遣“洒水飞机”灭火。他的建议被无视了。
"Perhaps, for an American, the closest thing to Notre-Dame, in its power to represent the nation, is the Statue of Liberty, work of a French sculptor. A mist hung over the water the other day, with the magical result that the torch of liberty hovered in the air, apparently detached. Seeing it, I imagined Emma Lazarus’s poem rewritten for the age of Trump:",也许，对一个美国人来说，就其代表国家的力量而言，最接近巴黎圣母院的东西就是由法国雕塑家创作的自由女神像。有一天，海面上笼罩着一层薄雾，带来一种神奇的效果，自由的火炬仿佛脱离了雕像，在空中盘旋。看着眼前这一幕，我想象着把埃玛·拉扎勒斯(Emma Lazarus)的诗为特朗普时代而改写：
"Give me your despots, your rich,",把你们的暴君、你们的富人，
"Your vulgar tax evaders yearning to flee,",你们企图溜走的可耻逃税者，
The depraved and debauched that itch,你们想偷东西的堕落败坏者交给我，
"To steal, I will make them free.",我要给他们自由。
"Send these, the dishonorable, to watch",把那些不体面的人交给我，看一看
How easy it is to corrupt like me.,像我这样败坏有多么容易。
"I don’t recall French civilization feeling so important in my lifetime. It’s what we have. There will be ugly polemics over the coming weeks, once the first shock passes, over who was responsible, how this disaster happened, what negligence was involved. But in those silent, reverent, hymn-singing crowds on the streets of Paris, I also saw the possibility of a French coming-together in the determination to rebuild — not only the cathedral, but also a nation shaken by the violence of the Yellow Vest movement and the social divisions it reflects. The story of Notre-Dame is a story of endurance and rebirth.",在我的一生中从未感觉到法国文明如此地重要。这就是我们所拥有的。未来几周，一旦第一波震颤过去，关于谁该对此负责、这场灾难是如何发生的、涉及了哪些疏忽，将会出现丑陋的争论。但在巴黎街头那些沉默、虔诚、唱着圣歌的人身上，我也看到了法国人团结起来，下定决心进行重建的可能——不仅要重建大教堂，还要重建一个被黄背心运动的暴力及其所反映的社会分裂所动摇的国家。巴黎圣母院的故事是一个坚忍和重生的故事。
"It is also a story of European civilization. Notre-Dame survived Hitler, just. Its fragility, now demonstrated, demands Europe’s unity, too.",这也是一个关于欧洲文明的故事。巴黎圣母院是从希特勒的手中幸存下来。如今它所呈现出的脆弱，同样需要欧洲的团结。
"In China, we have an old saying: “tian gao, huangdi yuan,” or, “the emperor is as far away as the sky.” We use it to reassure ourselves that in a country that is so big, with so many people, we can lose only so much freedom — the central government can’t monitor everyone.",中国有句老话，叫“天高皇帝远”。我们用它来宽慰自己，在一个面积这么大、人口这么多的国家，我们能失去的自由就这么些——中央政府不可能监控所有人。
"During my childhood in Shanghai in the 1990s, China thought of itself as working toward the so-called Singapore model. In middle school, my teacher told us that Singapore was a rich and beautiful country with an efficient, corruption-free government, and that China would be too, someday. I learned this model had a dark side only when I went to college, and a professor in international relations explained that Singapore was an authoritarian state, where the government wielded tremendous control over citizens’ daily lives.",我的童年时代是上世纪90年代在上海度过的，当时中国认为自己正朝着所谓的新加坡模式努力。在中学，我的老师告诉我们，新加坡是一个富裕又美丽的国家，有一个高效、廉洁的政府，未来有一天，中国也会那样。上大学的时候，我才知道这种模式的黑暗面，一位国际关系教授解释说，新加坡是一个专制国家，政府对民众的日常生活指手画脚。
"Even so, the idea that China would ever see either the best or the worst of the Singapore model seemed impossible. Singapore was a tiny city-state, with a population of less than six million; in China, tian gao, huangdi yuan. Today, however, it doesn’t seem so ridiculous: The emperor walks among us.",即便如此，中国走向新加坡模式，无论是它最好还是最差的一面，似乎都不太可能。新加坡是一个很小的城市国家，人口不足600万；而中国是天高皇帝远。不过在今天，这似乎没有那么荒谬了：皇帝就走在我们中间。
"It’s hard to say when I first became conscious of the idea that my privacy might be compromised. In 2010, when I graduated from college, I remember feeling optimistic about what the internet could offer. Books and movies that had once been banned in China for political reasons could be downloaded from 115 Wangpan, then the most popular Chinese cloud storage service. People talked about politics, albeit under pseudonyms, on forums like Tianya and Xici Hutong. Soon we had Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. Whenever some sort of domestic scandal occurred, we could follow the commentary posted by public intellectuals there, so we wouldn’t have to simply accept the government’s narrative.",很难说我什么时候开始意识到自己的隐私可能会受到侵犯。2010年，当我从大学毕业时，我记得自己对互联网所能带来的改变，是感到乐观的。曾因政治原因在中国被禁的书籍和电影，可以从当时最受欢迎的云存储服务115网盘下载。人们在天涯、西祠胡同等论坛上谈论政治，尽管用的是网名。很快我们又有了微博，它相当于中国的Twitter。每当国内发生丑闻时，我们可以在上面关注那些公共知识分子发表的评论，这样我们就不用只接受政府的一面之词。
"At the time, I felt that all this social media would help us form a true public sphere, that it would push China toward democracy and freedom of speech. I had so much faith in the future of my country that I quit a master’s program in Britain in 2011. I couldn’t wait to go back home; I believed it was poised to become a place where idealists like me would thrive.",当时我觉得，所有这些社交媒体将帮助我们形成一个真正的公共领域，它将推动中国走向民主和言论自由。我对祖国的未来充满信心，因此，我在2011年放弃了在英国的硕士学习。我迫不及待地想回家；我相信它会成为一个像我这样的理想主义者如鱼得水的地方。
"Looking back now, I realize that things had already started to change. In 2008, a few months before the Beijing Olympics, riots erupted in Lhasa, the Tibetan regional capital. The following year, unrest broke out in Urumqi, the capital city of Xinjiang, with reports of minority Uighurs targeting Han Chinese for violence. These episodes prompted an escalation of security checks around the country. Shortly before the Shanghai World Expo in 2010, security checks were instituted in the subway system. We grew used to policemen checking people’s identity cards in interchange stations.",现在回过头来看，我才意识到事情在此之前就已经发生了变化。2008年，就在北京奥运会开幕前几个月，西藏地区首府拉萨爆发骚乱。次年，新疆首府乌鲁木齐爆发暴乱，有报道称，少数民族维吾尔人发起了针对汉人的暴力活动。这些事件促使全国各地加强了安全检查。2010年上海世博会前不久，它的地铁系统增加了安检。慢慢地，我们习惯了警察在换乘站检查身份证。
"Over the next couple of years, the Weibo accounts of influential public figures started being shut down. We would hear stories about people saying things in WeChat groups, then being detained by the police, often on charges of disturbing the social order. Those stories would then disappear from the internet, making it impossible to know what had really happened.",在接下来的几年里，一些有影响力的公众人物的微博账号开始被注销。我们会听到有人因为在微信群说的话而遭警察拘留，通常他们被控扰乱社会秩序。然后，这些消息会在网上遭到删除，人们搞不清楚到底发生了什么。
"I came to the United States for a master’s degree in 2016, and I am not sure whether the experience of living overseas has increased my sensitivity about matters of privacy or not. I do remember waking up one morning in 2017 to a story that had gone viral in my WeChat feeds overnight: “A BBC reporter challenged China’s surveillance network — and it took only seven minutes to capture him!” I couldn’t tell which terrified me more: China’s all-encompassing network of facial recognition surveillance cameras, or that my countrymen were proudly cheering them on.",2016年我来到美国攻读硕士学位，我不确定海外生活的经历是否增加了我对隐私问题的敏感度。我确实记得2017年的一个早晨，我在微信上看到一篇一夜走红的报道：“BBC记者挑战中国天网工程，潜逃七分钟后被抓获！”我说不出哪个更让我害怕：是中国无所不在的人脸识别监控摄像头网络，还是我的同胞们在骄傲地为它喝彩。
"Last spring, I went back to China for a book tour that took me to six cities. Entering train stations felt like crossing border control at an international airport — my identity was not only confirmed by someone checking my documents, but also by one of the ubiquitous facial recognition cameras. One day, while a friend was driving me home after a reading in Shanghai, I saw one of them ahead of us on the highway. Well, we can no longer do “bad” things, he said, noticing my discomfort. It was supposed to be a joke, but we fell into a long, dead silence.",去年春天，我回到中国，在六个城市为我的书做巡回宣传。进入火车站就像在国际机场通过边境管制一样——不仅有人检查我的文件并确认我的身份，无处不在的面部识别摄像头也在确认我的身份。有一天，在上海的读书会后，一个朋友开车送我回家，我在高速公路上看到前面有一个摄像头。他注意到我的不适，说我们都不能干“坏事”了。这本来是一个玩笑，但我们陷入了长时间的死寂。
"Many people in China seem to be happy about the physical security promised by the surveillance network. Our mind-set, long ago, was wired to see safety and freedom as an either-or choice. I remember a conversation I had during my first year in the United States, when I was visiting Chicago. A Chinese student told me he dared not walk alone in the city after 5 p.m. When I told him I’d recently taken a trip to a nearby 7-Eleven at 10 p.m. by myself to get a beer, he was shocked. “Why?” I asked him. “It’s a safe neighborhood.” Still pale, he said, “You only got lucky.”",许多中国人似乎对监控网络承诺的人身安全感到高兴。长久以来，我们的思维定势是将安全和自由视为非此即彼的选择。我记得我在美国第一年访问芝加哥的时候，一个中国学生告诉我，他不敢在下午5点以后一个人在城里走。我告诉他，我前不久晚上10点一个人去附近的7-11便利店买啤酒，他惊呆了。“为什么？”我问他。“这一带是安全的。”他依然面色苍白，说：“你运气好而已。”
"The disappearance in June 2017 of Yingying Zhang, a young Chinese visiting scholar, from the Urbana-Champaign campus of the University of Illinois only reinforced this sense of danger everywhere outside China. Her kidnapping by a former graduate student made headlines across the country. The post that got the most shares in my WeChat feeds the week she disappeared was titled, “When you come to the States, leave behind feelings of homegrown safety. ”",2017年6月，年轻的中国访问学者章莹颖在伊利诺伊大学的厄巴纳-香槟分校失踪一案进一步强化了这种中国之外到处都很危险的感觉。她被一名前研究生绑架的消息引起举国的关注。她失踪的那一周，分享到我微信朋友圈里最多的一个帖子是:“别把国内的安全感带到美国。”
"The other reason that my people seem not to worry about the violation of their privacy is that they believe they are law-abiding citizens. “Only criminals need to be afraid,” they say. But I’ve heard other stories.",我的同胞似乎不担心隐私受侵犯的另一个原因是，他们认为自己是守法公民。“只有罪犯才需要害怕，”他们说。但我听过其他的故事。
"In 2018, Wang Qian, a young single mother from Zhejiang Province, hanged herself after she lost her savings on a peer-to-peer lending platform called PPMiao. In her suicide note, which briefly appeared on social media, she confessed her frustrations: Because she’d been a victim of a financial fraud — and therefore had grievances — she was now considered a threat to public safety and order.",2018年，浙江省的年轻单身母亲王倩在P2P借贷平台票票喵上失去了积蓄，随后自缢身亡。她的自杀遗书在社交媒体上短暂出现，她在其中承认了自己的沮丧：由于她是一场金融欺诈的受害者——因此心怀不满——她被认为对公共安全和秩序构成威胁。
"She said that she, as well as hundreds of other victims who’d tried to stage protests over their treatment, had been beaten by the police. One month before her suicide, investors like her who’d lost their money had planned a rally in Beijing — but only a few managed to show up, because policemen and security guards had gathered on every street corner and at subway stations to check the identity cards of everyone who was nearing Beijing’s financial district. The protest, like most of the other protests in China, was never reported in domestic news outlets.",她说，她和其他数百名受害者一样，遭到了警察的殴打。她自杀前一个月，像她一样失去资金的投资者计划在北京举行集会，但只有少数几个人出现在现场，因为警察和保安人员聚集在每个街角，在地铁站检查所有接近北京金融区的人的身份证。与中国其他大多数抗议活动一样，国内新闻媒体从未报道过这次活动。
"But maybe Ms. Wang’s story seems irrelevant to the average person, or at least not cause for alarm. Many who lost money in similar schemes have opted to eat their losses rather than risk trouble; those who haven’t shake their heads smugly, and blame others for lending money in the first place, under schemes that should have seemed too good to be true.",但是，普通人或许会觉得王倩的故事和自己毫无关系，或者至少不值得大惊小怪。许多在类似事件中蒙受损失的人选择了接受现实，而不是冒着惹麻烦的风险；没有遭受损失的人只是沾沾自喜地摇头，说其他人一开始就不该把钱借出去，这样的骗局看上去太美好了，不可能是真的。
"More interestingly and perhaps sadly too, the idea of tian gao, huangdi yuan has been replaced by its opposite. We have such a large population, my countrymen now say, if we don’t keep a watch on them, there’s no guarantee of safety. What once seemed unrealistic is made possible by technology, and justified in the name of security.",更有趣或许也更悲哀的是，“天高皇帝远”的概念已经被它的反面所取代。我的同胞们现在说，我们有这么多人口，如果我们不监视他们，安全就得不到保证。曾经看似不现实的东西，如今被技术变成了可能，并以安全的名义得到了正当化。
"And nowadays, no one talks about the Singapore model anymore. They talk about the China model.",如今，再也没有人谈论新加坡模式了。他们谈论中国模式。
"President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China will probably soon reach a trade agreement, but that won’t solve the biggest problems.",特朗普总统和中国国家主席习近平可能很快就会达成贸易协议，但这无法解决最大的问题。
"The Chinese regime is interning people based on religion in a more systematic way than any other regime since perhaps the Nazis. Its tolerance of fentanyl trafficking leads to some 20,000 drug overdose deaths in the United States each year. It steals intellectual property and ratchets up persecution at home.",中国政府正在根据人民的宗教信仰采取可能自纳粹以来最系统的拘禁行动。它对芬太尼走私的纵容导致美国每年约有2万人因药物过量死亡。它窃取知识产权，并在国内加大迫害力度。
"I lived in China, speak Chinese and deeply admire the country. Yet I am increasingly repulsed by Xi’s China, for he is dragging the country in the wrong direction by imprisoning lawyers, journalists and people of faith; tightening controls over the internet; creating international security risks in the South China Sea; and fostering a personality cult around himself.",我在中国生活过，会说中文，非常钦佩这个国家。然而，我对习近平治下的中国越来越反感，因为他囚禁律师、记者和教徒；加强对互联网的控制；在南海制造国际安全风险；在自己周围培养个人崇拜，他把这个国家拖向错误的方向。
"In fairness, it’s also true that the Chinese government has helped lift more people out of poverty than any other government in human history. Just since 1990, the mortality rate for children under 5 has fallen in China by 83 percent — suggesting, by my calculations, that an additional 676,000 Chinese children survive each year who previously would have died.",公平地说，中国政府帮助很多人摆脱贫困，比人类历史上的任何政府都多，这是实情。自1990年以来，中国五岁以下儿童死亡率下降了83%——根据我的计算，这意味着中国每年新增67.6万名儿童存活下来，在此之前他们可能死亡。
"Those of us who condemn China for human rights violations must also acknowledge this uncomfortable truth: A child born in Beijing today has a substantially longer life expectancy (82 years) than a child born in Washington, D.C. (77 years).",我们这些谴责中国侵犯人权的人，必须承认一个令人不安的事实：如今，在北京出生的儿童的预期寿命（82岁）比在华盛顿出生的儿童（77岁）长得多。
"In short, the Xi regime is complicated. It cheats, oppresses and brutalizes, but it also educates, enriches and saves lives.",简而言之，习近平政权是复杂的。它欺骗、压迫而残暴，但它也在教育、充实和挽救生命。
"I’ve seen the worst of China: I was on Tiananmen Square in 1989 when troops opened fire on the crowd I was in. I’ve also seen the best: impoverished families in western China moving out of caves into modern homes and sending their children to universities. I used to believe that China was best approached with ambivalence, but in the last few years the ambivalence has faded into wariness.",我见过中国最坏的一面：1989年我就在天安门广场，军队向我所在的人群开火。我也见过最好的事情：中国西部的贫困家庭搬出窑洞，搬进现代化的房屋，送孩子上大学。我曾经认为，与中国打交道最好是带着点矛盾心理，但在最近几年，这种矛盾已逐渐演变成警惕。
"When a trade deal is reached, President Trump may hail it as a triumph, and it will probably result in announcements of Chinese purchases of American goods. A trade deal is a good thing, but I hope that the United States will work with allies and firmly stand up to China on three issues in particular.",当贸易协议达成时，特朗普总统可能会欢呼这是胜利，它可能会导致中国宣布购买美国商品。贸易协议是好事，但我希望美国能与盟友合作，在以下三个问题上格外坚定地对抗中国。
"First, to the extent possible, we should try to curb Chinese high-technology firms’ access to Western markets. These businesses are a security threat, and the Trump administration is right to be concerned. If a company like Huawei is asked to cooperate with Chinese State Security spies, its executives simply can’t say no.",首先，我们应该尽可能地限制中国高科技公司进入西方市场。这些企业是安全威胁，特朗普政府有理由感到担忧。如果像华为这样的公司被要求与中国国家安全间谍合作，它的高管们肯定不会说不。
"This doesn’t mean that China is evil. American companies sold telecommunications equipment to China beginning in the 1980s that let us intercept officials’ conversations there, and we have inserted cyber “back doors” into goods and software sold to China so that we can cause damage in the event of a conflict. China purchased a Boeing 767 in 2000 to be its presidential jet and it arrived riddled with listening devices. China inevitably will try to do to us what we already did to it.",这并不意味着中国是邪恶的。从1980年代开始，美国公司向中国出售电信设备，使我们能够窃听中国官员的谈话。我们还在向中国出售的商品和软件中植入网络“后门”，以便在发生冲突时进行破坏。2000年，中国购买了一架波音767飞机作为其领导人专机，飞机交付时安装了许多监听设备。中国将会试图对我们做的事情，我们也做过，这是不可避免的。
"Second, we should continue to highlight human rights, especially China’s internment of perhaps one million Muslims in re-education camps. This is a staggering affront to religious liberty, with Chinese officials reportedly forcing Muslims to violate their faith by eating pork and drinking alcohol.",第二，我们应该继续强调人权，特别考虑到中国在将大约100万穆斯林关押在再教育营地。这是对宗教自由的惊人侵犯，据报道，中国官员强迫穆斯林违背自己的信仰，吃猪肉、喝酒。
"Bravo to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for forthrightly denouncing China’s “awful abuses” in detaining “hundreds of thousands and possibly millions of Uighurs,” as well as its persecution of Christians. The Chinese authorities have even installed monitoring cameras inside Muslims’ homes, and they have sent many Muslim parents to re-education camps, leaving the children left behind to be brainwashed in boarding schools.",国务卿迈克·庞皮欧(Mike Pompeo)直率地谴责了中国拘押“数十万可能是数百万维吾尔人”的“可怕的滥权行为”，以及中国对基督徒的迫害，他干得漂亮。中国当局甚至在穆斯林家中安装了监控摄像头，并将许多穆斯林家长送进再教育营，把孩子留在寄宿学校接受洗脑。
"Third, we need continued pressure on China over its exports of fentanyl, the synthetic opioid that is killing Americans in huge numbers through overdoses. Two-thirds or more of the fentanyl in the U.S. originates in China, where the authorities have been promising since 2016 to crack down on it.",第三，我们需要在芬太尼的出口问题上继续向中国施压，这种合成阿片类药物的服用过量正导致大量美国人死亡。美国三分之二或以上的芬太尼源自中国。自2016年以来，中国当局一直承诺对此事采取打击行动。
"A few days ago, China announced that it would soon ban all variants of fentanyl, a welcome step that may make a difference. But China often promises cooperation that does not materialize, and everything will depend on enforcement over the country’s 160,000 chemical companies. Too many lives hang in the balance to take China at its word.",几天前，中国宣布将很快禁止所有种类的芬太尼，这是一个令人欣喜的举措，可能会产生效果。但中国承诺的合作经常得不到实现，一切将取决于对中国16万家化工企业的执法。这关系到太多生命，不能只听中国嘴上说说就当真。
"About 20,000 Americans appear to be dying each year from Chinese fentanyl (some of it entering via Mexico). That’s a toll of devastation far greater than that caused by terrorists in the U.S. over multiple decades, and it should arouse far more outrage than Chinese companies pirating videos.",每年大约有两万名美国人死于中国的芬太尼（有些是从墨西哥进口）。这比几十年来恐怖分子给美国造成的破坏要严重得多，这应该激起比中国公司盗版视频更大的愤慨。
"So, sure, a good trade deal with China is welcome. But when so many Americans are dying from Chinese fentanyl, when one million Muslims are interned, when Emperor Xi is dragging China in the wrong direction, let’s not celebrate but, instead, keep up the international pressure.",当然，一项同中国的良好贸易协议是好事。但是，当这么多美国人死于中国的芬太尼，当100万穆斯林被拘禁，当习近平皇帝把中国拖向错误的方向时，我们不要庆祝，相反，要继续保持国际压力。
"If there’s one thing we know for certain about China in 2019, it’s that people there love their apps. They use WeChat to talk with friends; they spend hours battling virtual enemies on PUBG; they binge-watch short videos on Douyin. And so why shouldn’t the Communist Party get in on the action?",如果说2019年的中国有一件事是可以确定的，那就是人们对各种应用的喜爱。他们用微信和朋友聊天；投入大量时间在《绝地求生》(PUBG)上与虚拟敌人作战；在抖音上狂看短视频。既然如此，共产党何不参与进来呢？
"Xuexi Qiangguo — “study and make the nation great” — has become ubiquitous in China, an instant messenger, news aggregator and social network all in one introduced by the Publicity Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party in January. The first and second characters in the name, when combined — xuexi — mean “study/learn”; the same character, xi, also happens to be the character in President Xi Jinping’s surname. The app’s name, thus, can also be read as “study Xi and make the nation great.” And the Chinese are doing so, by the tens of millions.",“学习强国”在中国已经变得无处不在了，这是中共中央宣传部在今年1月份推出的一款集即时通讯、新闻聚合和社交网络于一体的产品。这个名称中的第一个字和第二个字放在一起构成“学习”一词，而习字恰好也是国家主席习近平的姓。因此，这款应用的名字也可以理解为“向习学习，让国家变得强大”。而中国人正在这么做，数以千万计的中国人。
"As of late March, Xuexi Qiangguo had been downloaded over 73 million times on Huawei’s app store. It’s also currently the most-downloaded app on Apple’s Chinese app store, which is hard to reconcile with its average rating of just 2.7 stars out of five, until you take into account that all government and state-owned-enterprise employees, along with tens of millions of party members, have been “encouraged” to use it and, sometimes, to compete with one another for the highest score.",截至3月底，“学习强国”在华为应用商店的下载量已超过7300万次。它也是苹果中国应用商店里目前下载量最大的应用，但很难与其平均2.7颗星（满分是5颗星）的评级相匹配，直到你考虑到所有的政府和国企员工，以及数千万党员都被“鼓励”使用它，有时为了获得最高分数还相互竞争。
"I wanted to experience Xuexi Qiangguo for myself — to see whether the shiny new technological gloss of an app could fundamentally transform the drudgery of daily ideological study. So last month I downloaded it and signed on. Suddenly there I was, immediately connected to my friends and colleagues. In the weeks since, I’ve been receiving several notifications a day; they include news coverage of Mr. Xi’s activities, a “golden quote of the day” from our president, “red patriotic songs” for me to listen to and links to online courses on traditional Chinese cultural heritage.",我想亲自体验一下“学习强国”——看看一款应用所采用的炫目的新技术能否让日常思想学习不再是件苦差事。所以上个月我下载、注册了“学习强国”。突然间，我已经立刻被与我的朋友和同事之间建立了联系。此后的几周里，我每天都会收到数条通知，包括对习近平出席各种活动的新闻报道，来自主席的“每日金句”，给我听的红歌，还有中国传统文化遗产在线课程的链接。
"But it wasn’t enough to simply sign on every once in a while or to click on some notifications. To do well on Xuexi Qiangguo requires a serious time commitment; those under peer pressure to use the app are typically expected to score two or three dozen points a day, and sometimes more. “Thirty points per day would only put me at the bottom among the members of the party branch I belong to,” one user on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter, told me. “My colleagues are so passionate about competing,” the user said, that they felt under pressure to earn the daily maximum of 66 points a day “to make sure I don’t get left behind.” (Late last month, after complaints from users who said they had to spend hours each day using the app, the government revised the ranking function so that users could no longer see one another’s scores, and revised down the daily cap to 52 points.)",但仅仅是偶尔登录或者点击一些通知是不够的。要想在学习强国上取得优异的表现，需要投入大量的时间；那些带着竞争压力使用这款应用程序的人，通常每天会得到二三十分，有时甚至更多。“每天30分只会让我在自己所属的党支部成员中垫底，”一位微博用户告诉我。微博相当于中国的Twitter。“我的同事都你追我赶，”这名用户说，他们压力很大，一天最多能拿到66分，“这样才能保证我不会落后。”（上个月底，在用户抱怨他们每天必须花几个小时使用这款应用程序后，政府修改了排名功能，让用户不再能看到彼此的得分，并将每日上限下调至52分。）
"In my first few weeks, I’d been getting a few points for just logging in, along with occasional peak-hour login bonuses. Reading articles on it and watching videos brought in another couple of points. But to really score highly, I needed to take the quizzes — to answer questions on Mr. Xi’s speeches and works. That was where the real points were: If I correctly answered all the quiz questions, I could earn 24 points total.",头几个星期我靠登录获得了一点积分，偶尔还会获得高峰时间登录奖励。阅读上面的文章和观看视频能再得几分。但要想获得高分就得参加小测验——回答关于习近平讲话和作品的问题。这才是真正的分数来源：如果能正确回答了所有测验问题，总共可以得到24分。
"And the questions were easy. The first one I encountered: “(Blank) is contemporary China’s Marxism, the 21st century’s Marxism, the guidance for our Party and our people to achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, a proven, practically great, powerful ideological weapon, and must be persisted in and developed consistently over a long term.” The answer? “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era,” of course. What else?",问题很简单。第一个是：“（空白）是当代中国马克思主义，21世纪马克思主义，是全党全国人民为实现中华民族伟大复兴而奋斗的行动指南，是经过实践检验、富有实践伟力的强大思想武器，必须长期坚持并不断发展。”答案？当然是“习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想”。还能是什么呢？
"Another question looked trickier at first glance: “Sticking to the Party’s overall leadership and coordination among different sectors, to build up a system with the Party’s full leadership role, and guarantee that the Party’s leadership is carried out in domains such as (blank), (blank), and (blank)”. Luckily, it was multiple choice. Among the answers were (A) Reforming, development and maintaining stability; (B) Domestic politics, foreign policy and defense; and (C) Governing the Party, the nation and the military. The answer was all of the above; the party is omnipotent, our leader in all arenas.",另一个乍看上去比较难的问题是:“坚持党总揽全局、协调各方，建立健全坚持和加强党的全面领导作用的制度体系，为把党的领导落实到（空白）、（空白）、（空白）各领域各方面各环节提供坚实制度保障。”幸运的是，这是多选题。答案包括(A)改革发展稳定；(B)内政外交国防；(C)治党治国治军。答案是以上皆是；党是全能的，是我们各方面的领袖。
"I gave up after about half an hour, earning a measly nine points. “Post your point of view and collect one point,” the app prompted. Why not? I thought, and moved into the comment section, only to be greeted with instructions like “only valid points of view will be awarded points” and “good comments will be prioritized for display.”",大约半小时后，我放弃了，只得到微不足道的9分。“发表观点+1分/次，”应用提示说。干嘛不试试呢？我心想，于是就进入了评论区，结果收到的提示是“1分/每发表一个有效观点”和“好观点将会被优先展示”。
"In the digital age, with increasingly powerful technology at their disposal, China’s propaganda authorities have developed quite a few high-tech tools aimed at spreading their message among tech-savvy youngsters and grooming so-called red millennials. Earlier this year, a seven-episode cartoon program about Karl Marx was streamed on the popular video site Bilibili. Last month, the state news agency Xinhua put out an English-language rap video praising the country’s accomplishments ahead of the “two sessions” — China’s annual parliamentary meetings.",在数字时代，随着技术的日益强大，中国的政府宣传部门开发了不少高科技工具，旨在向精通技术的年轻人传播他们的信息，培养所谓的红色千禧一代。今年早些时候，一个关于卡尔·马克思的七集动画片在流行视频网站哔哩哔哩上播出。上个月，中国国家通讯社新华社在两会前发布了一段英文说唱视频，赞扬中国取得的成就。

"Developed by the tech giant Alibaba, Xuexi Qiangguo has a certain polish to it. And it comes with some additional perks: Users can redeem their study points in businesses across the country for gifts like pastries, tablets, restaurant discounts and even free sightseeing tickets.",“学习强国”由科技巨头阿里巴巴开发，显然对其进行了一定的修饰。此外，它还提供一些额外的好处：用户可以用他们在全国各地企业的学习积分兑换礼物，比如糕点、平板电脑、餐厅折扣，甚至免费的观光票。
"But no matter how fancy the new products look on the surface, at their core they remain the mandatory study of ideologically correct materials and the demonstration of allegiance to the central government. The minute I entered the quiz section, memories of my middle school years in Chinese classrooms came flooding back: the grandiose language, the endless repetition, the fixed answers, the publicly displayed class rankings — the collective memories of Chinese students across several generations. Many Weibo users have pointed out the parallels between Xuexi Qiangguo and the fervent “Little Red Book” campaigns of the Mao era.",但是无论这些新产品表面上看起来多么花哨，其核心仍然是对意识形态材料的强制性学习，以及对中央政府表忠心。进入问答环节的那一刻，在中国的中学读书的记忆如潮水般涌回脑海：华而不实的语言、没完没了的重复、一成不变的答案、公开展示的班级排名——这是几代中国学生的集体记忆。许多微博用户指出，“学习强国”和毛泽东时代狂热的“红宝书”运动有相似之处。
"And as with so many instances in which the government demands correct thought, there are already those who have learned to cheat the system. There are a sizable number of articles on how to earn credits efficiently circulating on WeChat, while tech-savvy users have turned to GitHub to download software that will earn points for them on the app automatically while they spend their time elsewhere.",和很多政府要求思想正确的事例一样，已经有人学会了蒙蔽系统。大量关于如何高效赚取积分的文章在微信上流传，精通技术的用户则在GitHub下载软件，当他们在其他地方消磨时间时，这些软件可以自动在应用上赚取积分。
"So how effective has this new app effort been? Online user feedback is currently prohibited on the Apple app store, so we can gauge user’s reactions only through their earlier comments, before feedback was turned off. “Good, good, good,” one reviewer wrote. “Whatever you want me to say.” “We voluntarily downloaded this,” wrote another reviewer, who gave the app one star. “Truly.”",那么，这款新应用的效果如何呢？苹果应用商店目前禁止在线用户反馈，所以我们只能通过反馈关闭前的用户评论来判断他们的反应。“好好好，”一个评论写道“你让我说什么我就说什么。”“大家都是自愿的安装的，”另一位评论者写道，并给了这款应用一颗星。“没人强迫我们”。
Leaders of European Union countries plan to to discuss how China has expanded its business influence when they convene this week for a summit.,欧盟国家领导人计划在本周召开峰会时讨论中国如何扩大了其商业影响力。
"The Steve Jobs Theater on Apple’s spendy new campus in Cupertino, Calif., is a majestic temple to pomp. An ethereal glass-and-marble cylinder set high on a serene hill, the venue feels like the architectural manifestation of the Apple co-founder’s famous “reality-distortion field.” It is an edifice meant to recall those moments when Mr. Jobs, smirking joyfully, would bound up to the stage, teasingly pull a black shroud off some new invention and instantly alter your picture of the future.",位于加州库比蒂诺苹果公司新园区内的史蒂夫·乔布斯剧院(Steve Jobs Theater)是一座富丽的殿堂。一座玻璃和大理石的圆柱形建筑，高踞于宁静的山丘之上，感觉就像用建筑体现了这位苹果联合创始人著名的“现实扭曲力场”。这是一座旨在让人们回忆那些时刻的建筑，那时，乔布斯带着志得意满的笑容走上台，神秘兮兮地扯下一块黑色罩布，露出下面的新发明，当即改变你对未来的想象。
"And so it was meant to go once more last week, when Apple invited journalists and celebrities to an event billed as “a Think Different production.”",上周，苹果公司邀请记者和名流参加一场名为“不同凡响的产品”的发布会，也是为了再现这样的时刻。
"Some different thinking did seem in order. Since becoming the first trillion-dollar corporation last summer, Apple has battled a souring assessment on Wall Street. The iPhone is the most profitable product in the history of business, but more than a decade after its debut, pretty much everyone on the planet who can afford one already has one, and many customers see little reason to upgrade.",一些与众不同的想法似乎是需要的。自去年夏天成为第一家市值上万亿美元的公司以来，它在华尔街的口碑开始恶化，令公司疲于应对。IPhone是商业史上最赚钱的产品，但在上市十几年后，地球上几乎所有买得起iPhone手机的人都已经拥有了一部，而很多顾客认为没什么理由更新换代。
"So now, instead of selling better stuff to more people, Apple’s new plan is to sell more stuff to the same people. “Today is going to be a very different kind of event,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, taking the stage.",所以，如今苹果的新计划不是把更好的产品卖给更多的人，而是把更多的产品卖给同样的人。“今天将是一场非常不同寻常的活动，”苹果首席执行官蒂姆·库克(Tim Cook)登台后说。
"It was not. From start to finish, Apple’s affair was a brushed-aluminum homage to sameness — a parade of services that start-ups and big rivals had done earlier, polished with an Apple-y sheen of design and marketing. Among other offerings, Apple showed off a service for subscribing to news on your phone and a credit card, and it offered vague details about a still-in-development TV service involving Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey (who are not exactly edgy or up-and-coming).",并没有什么不同寻常的。从始至终，苹果所作的都是以拉丝铝材打造的千篇一律——一系列初创企业和大型竞争对手之前就已经做过的服务，只在设计和营销方面增加了一点苹果的光辉。在所有新产品中，苹果特别展示了一项在手机上订阅新闻的服务、一种信用卡、以及一项尚在开发中的电视服务的模糊细节，史蒂文·斯皮尔伯格(Steven Spielberg)和奥普拉·温弗瑞(Oprah Winfrey)会参与其中（他们可谈不上是前沿或新锐）。
"None of these efforts look terrible. Some, like the news service, might be handy. Yet they are all so trifling and derivative. As the analyst Ben Thompson noted, Apple’s crush of me-too announcements falls far short of Mr. Jobs’s goal of putting “a ding in the universe.” As I watched Apple’s event, I felt the future shrink a little. In its gilded middle age, Apple is turning into something like a digital athleisure brand, stamping out countless upscale accessories for customers who love its one big thing, a company that has lost sight of the universe and is content merely to put a ding in your pocketbook.",这些努力看上去都并不糟糕。其中一些可能会带来方便，比如新闻服务。然而，它们都是如此微不足道而且缺乏独创性。正如分析师本·汤普森(Ben Thompson)指出的，苹果对亦步亦趋产生的兴趣，与乔布斯“在宇宙中留下痕迹”的目标相去甚远。看到苹果的发布会时，我觉得未来有点失色。在镀金的中年时期，苹果正在变成一个类似于数字运动休闲品牌的东西，为喜欢它的某件重要产品的客户推出无数高端配件。这家公司已经失去了展望宇宙的视野，只满足于在你的钱包里留下痕迹。
"In an ordinary time, such an ordinary corporate vision might be fine. But these aren’t ordinary times, and Apple is no ordinary company. Here is a corporation with the resources of an empire, the mass devotion of a religion and the operational capacity of a war machine. Under Mr. Cook, Apple has cannily avoided every minefield in tech and politics over the past couple of years, winning a windfall from President Trump’s tax cut, avoiding getting burned in his trade war — all while enjoying the loyalty of every moneyed hipster and suburbanite on earth.",在一个普通的时代，这样一个普通的企业愿景可能是好的。但眼下不是普通的时代，苹果也不是一个普通的公司。这家公司拥有堪比帝国的资源、堪比宗教信仰的大众忠诚度和堪比战争机器的运作能力。在库克的领导下，苹果公司在过去几年里巧妙地避开了科技和政治领域的每一个雷区，从特朗普总统的减税政策中获得了意外之财，避免了在他的贸易战中遭受损失——与此同时，它还享受着地球上每一个有钱的时髦人士和郊区阶层的忠诚。
"Yet, all around Apple, the digital world is burning up. Indirectly, Apple’s devices are implicated in the rise of misinformation and distraction, the erosion of privacy and the breakdown of democracy. None of these grand problems is Apple’s fault, but given its centrality to the business, Apple has the capacity and wherewithal to mitigate them. But instead of rising to the moment by pushing a fundamentally new and safer vision of the future, Apple is shrinking from it.",然而，在苹果周围，数字世界正在燃烧。苹果设备与虚假信息和干扰信息的增多、对隐私的侵蚀和民主的崩溃都间接有关。所有这些大问题都不是苹果的错，但鉴于苹果在业内的核心地位，它有能力、也有必要缓解这些问题。但是，苹果并没有通过推动一个全新的、更安全的未来愿景来迎接这一时刻，而是在向后退缩。
"Consider privacy. Mr. Cook is one of the tech industry’s strongest champions of the sanctity of our private information, and Apple has pushed for more stringent privacy regulations — which is just about the least Apple could do. But what if it thought a little bigger? For example, it could directly take on Google and Facebook — the demons who rule our era of surveillance capitalism — by placing far more stringent restrictions on their culture of rampant invasion, or at least removing them from preferential places in the iPhone. (Google will pay Apple an estimated $12 billion in 2019 to act as the default search engine on the iPhone.)",想想隐私问题。库克是科技行业中捍卫个人信息神圣性的最有力倡导者之一，苹果一直在推动更严格的隐私规定——这只是苹果所能做的最起码的事情。但如果它的目标更远大一点呢？比如，它可以直接挑战谷歌和Facebook——统治我们这个监控资本主义时代的魔鬼们——对它们猖獗入侵的文化施加更严格的限制，或者至少将它们从iPhone的优先位置移除。（2019年，谷歌将向苹果支付约120亿美元，使其成为iPhone的默认搜索引擎。）
"More than restricting the present, Apple could deploy its billions to build a better digital future. In particular, I wonder why Apple isn’t working feverishly to create new privacy-minded versions of social-media services the world needs.",苹果不仅可以对当下作出限制，还可以动用它所拥有的数千亿美元打造一个更美好的数字未来。我尤其想知道，苹果为什么不积极地为社交媒体服务开发全世界都很需要的、更注重隐私的全新版本。
"Take messaging, for starters. There is a strong moral case for Apple to turn iMessage, its encrypted messaging app, into an open standard available to anyone, even Android users, who currently lack many privacy-minded messaging apps that aren’t run by an ad company or aren’t friendly with the Chinese government.",首先以短信为例。苹果有充分的道德理由将其加密的即时通讯应用iMessage变成一个开放的标准，任何人都可以使用，甚至包括安卓用户。目前，Android用户缺乏有隐私意识、由非广告公司运营、或与中国政府不友好的即时通讯应用。
"There might be a business case, too. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder, recently reoriented his company toward messaging. As Will Oremus noted in Slate, the move brings Facebook into direct competition with Apple. This presents an opportunity for Apple to turn a cold war into a hot one; Apple could swiftly undercut Mr. Zuckerberg’s ambition by freeing iMessage and bringing the gift of privacy to the non-Apple world.",这也可以成为商业案例。Facebook创始人马克·扎克伯格(Mark Zuckerberg)最近将公司的业务重心转向了即时通讯。正如威尔·奥雷莫斯(Will Oremus)在Slate杂志上所指出的，此举将使Facebook与苹果展开直接竞争。这为苹果提供了一个将冷战转变为热战的机会；通过开放iMessage，将保护隐私的礼物带给非苹果世界，苹果可能会迅速削弱扎克伯格的野心。
Here are some other big ideas: Apple could embark on a long-term project to create a privacy-minded search engine to rival Google’s. It could build an ad-free Instagram (its founders just left Facebook in frustration). It could create a YouTube that isn’t a haven for neo-Nazis.,还有其他一些重大设想：苹果可以着手一个长期的项目，创建一个注重隐私的搜索引擎，与谷歌竞争。它可以建立一个没有广告的Instagram（其创始人刚刚沮丧地离开Facebook）。它还可以创建一个不会为新纳粹分子提供避风港的YouTube。
"Some (or many) of these may be dumb ideas — ideas that would ruin Apple, or at the very least kneecap its short-run profits. But they are at least big ideas; they match in scope and daring what Apple was created to do. Let other companies handle streaming entertainment. To paraphrase a wise man: Does Mr. Cook want to sell prestige TV for the rest of his life, or does he want to change the world?",其中一些（或许多）想法可能是愚蠢的——这些想法可能会毁了苹果，或者至少会让苹果的短期利润遭受重创。但它们至少是伟大的想法；它们的广度和大胆能配得上苹果的初衷。让其他公司去搞流媒体娱乐吧。套用一位智者的话说：库克先生是想下半辈子就做个卖高端电视剧集的，还是想改变世界？
"Last Sunday, shortly after Attorney General William Barr had released his no collusion/maybe obstruction summary of Robert Mueller’s report, I spotted George Conway wandering out of the National Zoo, in Northwest Washington.",上周日，在司法部长威廉·P·巴尔(William P. Barr)公布了他的“无串谋/可能妨碍司法”的罗伯特·穆勒(Robert Mueller)报告摘要后不久，我在华盛顿西北的国家动物园看到乔治·康维(George Conway)正走出来。
"George, as anyone even casually familiar with the wacky spectacles surrounding our 45th president is aware, is the prominent conservative lawyer who has been increasingly open about his contempt for Donald Trump, mostly via Twitter. This is notable because he is also the husband of the White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, making him one-half of the marital embodiment of Trump-era Washington — a seething, divided, bizarre crucible, in other words.",任何对我们的第45届总统身边的种种怪现象略知一二的人都认得乔治，一位日益公开表达——主要是通过推特——对唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)的蔑视的著名保守派律师。这一点之所以值得注意，是因为他还是白宫顾问凯莉安·康维(Kellyanne Conway)的丈夫，这使他成为特朗普时代华盛顿——换句话说，一个沸腾、分裂、怪诞的大熔炉——某种婚姻化身的其中一半。
"George wore a dark polo shirt and appeared to be alone on this warm afternoon. I imagined him to be depressed over Mr. Barr’s synopsis and out for a walk to clear his head while his wife labored triumphantly at the White House. I barely know George. We’ve met a few times and texted occasionally (like many Washington reporters, I’ve tried to interview him about his marriage, to no avail). I decided to leave him alone with his thoughts.",在这个暖和的下午，乔治身穿黑色马球衫，似乎是独自一人。我想象他是对巴尔的结论感到沮丧，出来走走清理下思绪，而他的妻子正在白宫欢天喜地忙碌着。我和乔治仅是点头之交。我们见过几次，偶尔发些信息（像华盛顿的很多记者一样，我试着就他的婚姻采访他，但没有结果）。我决定不去打搅他的思绪。
"He later confirmed (via text) that it was he, but that he was not alone; George said he was shepherding a bunch of kids around the zoo, a task that he compared to herding wild animals. “Or working at the White House,” I replied, trying to egg him on. He didn’t bite, at least on the record.",他后来（通过短信）确认那确实是他，但他不是一个人；乔治说他是在动物园周围看管一群孩子，他把这个任务比作放牧野生动物。“或者在白宫工作，”我回复道，试着刺激下他。他没上钩，至少不会给可供发表的东西。
"George has complained to friends that Kellyanne has fallen inexplicably under the thrall of President Trump — and that he would prefer a wife who was not captured. Kellyanne, meanwhile, believes that her husband has been disrespectful of her in his public criticisms of her boss, and she wishes he would air his complaints in private. It’s obviously more complicated, but those seem to be the broad contours of their grievances.",乔治曾向朋友抱怨，凯莉安已令人费解地臣服于特朗普总统的威力——而他希望自己的妻子没有被俘虏。与此同时，凯莉安认为丈夫一直对她缺乏尊重，公开批评她的上级，她希望他能私下发牢骚。事情显然没那么简单，但他们的不满大致上就是这样。
"By all appearances, it had been another belligerent week for the Conways. George had just a few days earlier tweeted out clinical definitions of narcissistic personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder in reference to the president of the United States. He went on to suggest that “a serious inquiry needs to be made about this man’s condition of mind.” His wife, all the while, continued to stand by her man — in this case, the man in the White House.Kellyanne countered that she did not share her husband’s concern for the president’s mental well-being, and then added something sarcastic about how she had been taking care of the couple’s four children that morning and was engaging in real “substantive” conversations with Mr. Trump so (if you’ll excuse her) she might not be fully up to speed on whatever it was her husband was tweeting about that morning.",从各种迹象来看，康维一家又在冲突中度过了一周。乔治几天前发推谈及美国总统时列出了自恋型人格障碍及反社会型人格障碍的临床定义。他接着提议“需对此人的心理状况进行认真的调查。”而他的妻子一如既往地继续维护她的人——具体在这里是指白宫里那个。凯莉安反驳称，她不像丈夫那样担心总统的心理健康，然后她说了些讥讽的话，说到那天早上她如何一直在照看俩人的四个孩子，同时在和特朗普进行着真正“有实质意义”的交谈，所以（请原谅她）可能无法及时了解他丈夫那天早上发了什么推。
"Naturally, the president himself weighed in, dismissing George — “Mr. Kellyanne Conway” — as “a total loser” and the “husband from hell.” This was not your standard strange Washington bedfellow shtick, in other words. It was a far cry from the love prevailing over politics meme and Americans learning to disagree without being disagreeable, and all that.Politics has always loved a good odd-couple story. That the cable combatants James Carville (the Bill Clinton strategist) and Mary Matalin (the Bush and Cheney operative) were married in real life held a certain novelty and quaintness in the relatively tame Beltway soap opera of the 1990s. It could also be marketable. The Carville-Matalin political-enemies/life-partners routine reaped them a fortune of book, speaking, TV and endorsement deals.",总统本人自然也要说上两句，他鄙夷地说乔治——“凯莉安·康维先生”——是个“彻底的失败者”、“来自地狱的丈夫”。换句话说，这不是奇怪的华盛顿床伴之间的标准滑稽场面。这远不是什么爱情超越政治的米姆，也不是美国人学会了求同存异之类。政治向来都喜好精彩的貌合神离故事。詹姆斯·卡维尔（James Carville，比尔·克林顿的策略师）和玛丽·玛塔林（Mary Matalin，布什和切尼的特工）这对有线新闻战士是真实生活中的夫妻，这在1990年代相对温和的华盛顿政界肥皂剧中还有一定的新奇和怪异感。那是有销路的。卡维尔-玛塔琳式的政敌/人生伴侣日常，帮他们收获了数量颇丰的图书、演讲、电视和代言协议。
"But the love-over-politics plotline seems to be another casualty of an administration that has torched even the most time-honored of Washington chestnuts. Far from anything uplifting, the ballad of George and Kellyanne has provided a running background mishegoss to the main noise. George will tweet, with increasing disgust, about the president; people (who pay attention to these things) will notice, and the media will cover it, especially when he takes on a matter relating to presidential scandal, including impeachment, which he had experience with as a prime mover against Bill Clinton’s presidency two decades ago.",但这个爱情超越政治的情节，似乎是把华盛顿历史最悠久的故事都付之一炬的特朗普政府的又一个牺牲品。乔治和凯莉安的情歌一点也不令人为之一振，只不过是为主噪音提供了一个连续的疯狂背景而已。乔治还发推文对总统表达越来越多的厌恶；人们（关心这些事情的人们）会注意到这些推文，媒体也会加以报道，尤其是在他决定对与总统丑闻有关的事情发推时，包括弹劾。他有过弹劾的经历，20年前，他是起诉比尔·克林顿(Bill Clinton)总统的主要推动者之一。
"It’s also hard to look away when George seems to implicitly — or explicitly — chastise those who still support and enable Mr. Trump (for example, his wife). Members of Team Kellyanne jump on Twitter to retaliate, on her behalf. Trump’s 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said George was a bad husband, and Eric Trump called his actions “horrible.” George told The Washington Post that he was compelled to tweet about the White House “so I don’t end up screaming at her,” meaning Kellyanne. All totally normal!",当乔治看似含蓄地——或明确地——批评那些仍支持特朗普，并让特朗普成为可能的人时（比如他自己的妻子），人们很难不予以关注。“凯莉安团队”的成员们迫不及待地到Twitter上替她进行报复。特朗普2020年竞选班子的经理布拉德·帕尔斯凯尔(Brad Parscale)说，乔治是个坏丈夫，埃里克·特朗普称他的行为“可恶”。乔治对《华盛顿邮报》说，他不得不发推谈论白宫，“这样我就不会对她（凯莉安）大喊大叫了。”一切都完全正常！
"At first, it was impossible not to wonder whether the Conways were staging some elaborate marital feud, tailor-made to gin up maximum publicity in the attention vortex that is Donald Trump’s White House. Were they positioning themselves for some kind of post-White House “reconciliation” act? You could imagine the joint memoir or reality show or live stage possibilities.",刚开始时，人们不可能不想知道康维夫妇是否在精心策划一场婚姻纠纷，在唐纳德·特朗普的白宫——这个注意力漩涡中最大限度地吸引公众注意力。他们是在为某种后白宫时代的“和解”剧做准备吗？你可以想像共同回忆录、真人秀或现场舞台的可能性。
"But it is also impossible not to wonder whether their joint memoir is being written in real time, and we are watching a life partnership fracture on Twitter, a casualty of a third wheel in the marriage — Donald Trump.",但人们也不可能不怀疑他们是否正在实时写作共同回忆录，我们正在Twitter上目睹一对人生伴侣的决裂，以及又一个唐纳德·特朗普——这个婚姻中的“电灯泡”——的牺牲品。
"This is the part of the story where we call in the authorities to remind us that (slowly, everyone) no one really knows what goes on in the privacy of a marriage. “Hey, I don’t live in their house,” Mr. Carville cautioned when I reached him by phone in Louisiana, where he and Ms. Matalin have lived for 12 years in apparent harmony (and if not, it would be off-brand, so they would never tweet about it). “They might be the happiest people or the saddest people in the world,” Mr. Carville said of the Conways. “Or maybe somewhere in between, like everyone.”",故事发展到我们把专家叫来提醒我们的时候了。专家慢言慢语地对大家说，外人不可能真地了解私密婚姻中发生的事情。“嘿，我不住在他们家，”我打电话给住在路易斯安那州的卡维尔时，他提醒我说。他和马塔林在路易斯安那州已经和睦地在一起住了12年了（如果不是的话，也是没标牌的，他们永远不会发推谈论自己的生活）。“他们可能是世界上最幸福的人，也可能是世界上最悲伤的人，”卡维尔在谈到康维夫妇时说。“或者可能和所有的人一样，介于两者之间。”
"Remember, too, that we are living in what’s becoming an intensely performative culture, with new outlets for different personas — one for home; one for work; one for Instagram, cable, etc. Open friction is no longer so easily subsumed by the almighty virtue of comity. “Everybody seems to be playing a certain role, and that should add another layer of skepticism about what’s really going on with people,” said Gil Troy, a presidential historian at McGill University who has written about political couples.",还需记住，我们生活在一个正在成形的强烈表现文化之中，不同的人格面具都有了新的表现场合——家里的，工作时的，用于Instagram的，上有线电视的，等等。公开的摩擦不再那么容易被礼仪的全能美德所包纳。“每个人似乎都在扮演某种角色，这应该对了解人们之间的真实状况又增添了一层怀疑，”麦吉尔大学(McGill University)研究总统的历史学家吉尔·特洛伊(Gil Troy)说，他曾写过关于政治夫妻的文章。
"To strike a more neutral note: Maybe the Conways simply embody the Washington power couple we all deserve in the Trump era. “This marriage represents the train wreck that is our current political culture,” Professor Troy said. “We are all intertwined as Americans, like we’re all in a marriage together and constantly colliding against one another. No one knows who’s going to break first and what will be the breaking point.”",说得更中性一点：也许康维夫妇不过是特朗普时代，我们值得看到的华盛顿权力夫妻的体现。“他们的婚姻是当下出轨列车般政治文化的代表，”特洛伊说。“作为美国人，我们都纠缠在一起，就像我们都处在同一个婚姻中那样，不断地相互冲突。没有人知道谁会先崩溃，也没有人知道崩溃点在哪里。”
We are all the Conways.,我们都是康维夫妇。
"On Friday, Lucy Flores, a former Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor of Nevada, accused Joe Biden of touching her inappropriately as they waited to take the stage at a 2014 election rally. He put his hands on her shoulders, she said, then nuzzled her hair and kissed the back of her head. She didn’t accuse Biden, who is reportedly close to announcing his presidential candidacy, of sexual harassment or assault, just of making her uncomfortable. “I’m not suggesting that Biden broke any laws, but the transgressions that society deems minor (or doesn’t even see as transgressions) often feel considerable to the person on the receiving end,” she wrote.",上周五，曾竞选内华达州副州长的民主党人露西·弗洛雷斯(Lucy Flores)指责乔·拜登(Joe Biden)在2014年的一次竞选集会上，在等待登台期间不恰当地触摸了她。她说，他把手放在她的肩膀上，用脸蹭她的头发，吻她的脑后。她没有指责据报道将宣布竞选总统的拜登犯有性骚扰或性侵犯行为，只是表示拜登让她觉得不舒服。“我并不是说拜登违反了任何法律，但被社会视为轻微过失（甚至不被视为过失）的行为，往往会让承受它的人感到相当严重，”她写道。
"In response, Biden released a statement saying that while he’s often been physically affectionate as a politician, “not once — never — did I believe I acted inappropriately.”",作为回应，拜登发表声明说，虽然作为政治人物，他的肢体语言往往充满感情，“但我认为自己从来没有——一次也没有——任何不当行为。”
"Then, on Monday, Amy Lappos, a former aide to the Democratic congressman Jim Himes, told The Hartford Courant that Biden pulled her toward him to rub noses during a 2009 fund-raiser. “There’s absolutely a line of decency,” Lappos said, adding: “Crossing that line is not grandfatherly. It’s not cultural. It’s not affection. It’s sexism or misogyny.” Biden’s campaign hadn’t yet begun and was already in crisis.",然后在周一，民主党国会议员吉姆·希姆斯(Jim Himes)的前助手艾米·拉波斯(Amy Lappos)对《哈特福德新闻报》(The Hartford Courant)说，在2009年的一次筹款活动上，拜登把她拉到自己身边，用鼻子蹭她的鼻子。“这绝对跨越了一条得体言行的界线，”拉波斯说，她还说：“他的跨越不是什么祖父式的亲昵。这不是文化。不是喜爱。这是性别歧视或厌女。”拜登的竞选活动还没有开始，已经处于危机之中。
"Flores, Lappos and Biden are probably all telling the truth. There are countless photos of Biden behaving in the ways that Flores and Lappos describe: squeezing women, rubbing their shoulders, leaning in too close. All this was open, not furtive, presumably because it never occurred to Biden that he was doing anything untoward.",弗洛雷斯、拉波斯和拜登可能都说的是真话。有无数照片显示拜登的行为就像弗洛雷斯和拉波斯描述的那样：贴近女人，抚摸她们的肩膀，俯身靠得太近。所有这一切都是公开的，不是偷偷摸摸的，大概是因为拜登从未想过自己是在做什么不恰当的事。
"I don’t necessarily blame him. In the past few years, women have been calling out daily indignities that previous generations grew up quietly tolerating: lingering hugs from a boss, embarrassing intimate questions, crude office jokes. Individually, these are small acts, and most men probably don’t understand how cumulatively draining they can be. Women, after all, have only recently begun to articulate it.",我不见得一定要怪罪他。在过去的几年里，女人们一直在为过去几代人成长过程中默默忍受的日常侮辱大声疾呼：老板长时间的拥抱、令人尴尬的私密问题、粗俗的办公室笑话。就个人而言，这些都是小事，大多数男人可能不明白这些行为累积起来会有多么让人厌烦。毕竟，女人们只是从最近才开始表达这一点。
"I received plenty of unwanted shoulder massages when I was younger, and for a long time I assumed there was something wrong with me when they made me flinch. It was affirming to finally realize that other women also hated routine invasions of their personal space. But if it wasn’t always obvious to me that the men were at fault in these awkward encounters, it might not have been obvious to them, either.",我年轻的时候也受过很多不必要的肩部按摩，有很长一段时间，它们让我感到不自在，而我还以为这是我的问题。最后我终于意识到，其他女性也讨厌这种对她们私人空间的习惯性侵犯，这很令人鼓舞。但是，在这些尴尬的遭遇中，如果我并不总能明显感觉这些男人有错，那么他们也未必能明显地感觉到。
"So I don’t think Biden’s avuncular pawing is a #MeToo story. (Lappos specifically said the way he grabbed her “wasn’t sexual.”) But if Biden was more oblivious than predatory, his history still puts him out of step with the mores of an increasingly progressive Democratic Party. On Sunday, The New York Times reported that some Democrats are bracing “for an extended reckoning about Mr. Biden and gender if he enters the race.” The inevitably of such a reckoning should make Biden reconsider getting in.",所以我不认为拜登慈祥的动手动脚是一个“#我也是”故事。（拉波斯特别指出，他抓住她肩膀的方式“与性无关”。）但是，就算拜登不是性侵，只是没有意识，他过去的历史也仍然让他与日益进步的民主党道德观格格不入。周日，《纽约时报》报道称，一些民主党人正在做准备，“如果拜登参选，会对他和性别问题进行更广泛的评估。”这种评估不可避免地会让拜登重新考虑是否参选。
"Biden’s issues with gender, after all, go far beyond chronic handsiness. His waffling on reproductive choice troubles many feminists; as The Times reported last week, Biden’s “back-and-forth over abortion would become a hallmark of his political career.” He was the chairman of the hearings on Clarence Thomas’s Supreme Court nomination, where Anita Hill, who accused Thomas of sexual harassment, was demeaned and dismissed. Though Biden has expressed sorrow for how Hill was treated, he’s never directly apologized to her.",毕竟，拜登在性方面的问题远远不止于长期的毛手毛脚。他在生育选择上的胡诌令许多女性主义者深感困扰；正如《纽约时报》上周报道的那样，拜登“在堕胎问题上的反复将成为他政治生涯中的一个标志”。他是克拉伦斯·托马斯(Clarence Thomas)被提名为最高法院大法官的听证会主席，会上指控托马斯性骚扰的安妮塔·希尔(Anita Hill)遭到羞辱和贬低。尽管拜登对希尔受到的待遇表示痛心，但他从未直接向希尔道歉。
"Beyond gender, on issue after issue, if Biden runs for president he will have to run away from his own record. He — and by extension, we — will have to relive the debate over the Iraq war, which he voted to authorize. He’ll have to explain his vote to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act, which, by lifting regulations on banking, helped create the conditions for the 2008 financial meltdown. (Biden has called that vote one of the biggest regrets of his career.) In 2016, Hillary Clinton was slammed for her previous support of the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which contributed to mass incarceration. Biden helped write the law, which he called, in 2015, the “1994 Biden crime bill.”",除了性别问题，如果拜登竞选总统，他将不得不在一个又一个问题上为自己曾经的言论找借口。他——进而也包括我们——将不得不重温有关伊拉克战争的辩论——他在战争授权上投了赞同票。他将不得不解释他投票废除《格拉斯-斯蒂格尔法案》(Glass-Steagall Act)的原因，该法案解除了对银行业的监管，为2008年的金融危机制造了条件。（拜登称那是他政治生涯最后悔的投票之一。）2016年，希拉里·克林顿(Hillary Clinton)因之前支持1994年的《暴力犯罪控制和执法法案》(Violence Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act)而受到抨击，该法案导致了大规模监禁。拜登协助起草了这项法案，他在2015年曾称之为“1994年拜登犯罪法案”。
"None of this means that Democrats need to disavow Biden. He is by most accounts a man of great personal decency. As vice president, he pushed Barack Obama’s administration in the right direction on issues including gay marriage and campus sexual assault. It’s not surprising that he leads most polls of 2020 Democrats; he is well known and well loved.",这些都不等于民主党人需要跟拜登划案而坐。多数人都说他是个非常正派的人。作为副总统，他推动奥巴马政府在同性恋婚姻和校园性侵犯等问题上朝着正确的方向前进。他在大多数2020年民主党竞选民调中领先是意料之中的；他很有名，也很受爱戴。
"Still, the widespread assumption that Biden would pose the strongest challenge to Donald Trump is unwarranted. In recent years, neither party has done well when they’ve chosen candidates who were meant to appeal to some elusive cadre of swing voters but lacked a robust grass-roots base. On paper, the war heroes John Kerry and John McCain looked electable; Obama and Trump did not. To those desperate to unseat Trump, the centrist, establishment Biden might seem like the safest choice, but it would actually be risky to pick a candidate who will need to constantly apologize for himself.",不过，关于拜登将对唐纳德·特朗普构成最大挑战的普遍看法，是没有根据的。近年来，两党做得都不是很好，他们选择的候选人本想吸引摇摆选民中那些难以捉摸的核心群体，但却缺乏坚实的草根基础。从理论上说，战争英雄约翰·克里(John Kerry)和约翰·麦凯恩(John McCain)看似有可能当选的；奥巴马和特朗普则看似不太可能。对于那些迫切希望把特朗普赶下台的中间派来说，建制派拜登似乎是最安全的选择，但是选择一个需要不断为自己道歉的候选人实际上是有风险的。
"Particularly when he doesn’t know how to do that very well. In response to Flores, Biden could have told her that he was sorry for making her uneasy. Instead, he focused on his intentions rather than her experience, a faint echo of the way he’d ignored Hill’s experience decades ago. No one should judge the whole span of Biden’s career by the standards of 2019, but if he’s going to run for president, it’s fair to ask whether he’s the right leader for this moment. He is a product of his time, but that time is up.",尤其是他有时不知道怎样才能做好这件事。作为对弗洛雷斯的回应，拜登本可以告诉她，他很抱歉让她感到不适。相反，他关注的是自己的意图，而不是她的体验，这有点像几十年前他忽视希尔的经历。没有人应该用2019年的标准来评判拜登的整个生涯，但如果他要竞选总统，我们有理由去问，他究竟是不是适合当下的领导人。他是他那个时代的产物，但那个时代已经走到头了。
"It has been another bad inning for male leadership. Besides the hourly flatulence of Trumpian twitterings and the addition of Brazil’s Bolsonaro to the confederacy of bullyboy power, we have been treated to a second wave of masculine mayhem. The reputations of the Patriots owner Robert Kraft, R. Kelly, the philanthropist Michael Steinhardt and even the sainted co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, Morris Dees, are the latest to circle the drain. As Harvard’s Cornel West recently observed to Anderson Cooper, “The brothers are just out of control.”",对男性领导者来说，这又是糟糕的一局。除了特朗普不停发推大放厥词、巴西的博索纳罗(Bolsonaro)加入流氓权力联盟外，我们还有幸又目睹了一波男性胡来的景象。新英格兰爱国者队(Patriots)老板罗伯特·K·克拉夫特(Robert K. Kraft)、歌手R·凯利(R. Kelly)、慈善家迈克尔·斯坦哈特(Michael Steinhardt)，甚至南方贫困问题法律中心(Southern Poverty Law Center)德高望重的创始人莫里斯·迪斯(Morris Dees)都是名誉扫地的最新代表。正如哈佛的科内尔·韦斯特(Cornel West)最近向安德森·库珀(Anderson Cooper)所说的，“兄弟们失控了。”
"Can women save the world? A ripped Captain Marvel can rescue us from intergalactic enemies, but down here on planet Earth a new paradigm of female leadership is emerging. A year ago, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand was famous for being a world leader who gave birth while in office. Then came the slaughter in the Christchurch mosques and overnight the gravitas in her angular face beneath a hijab became an iconic image of global humanity. As women across New Zealand emulated her gesture of solidarity by donning head scarves, the Arab world took note. A portrait of Ms. Ardern was projected across the world’s tallest building, Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, with the word “Peace” emblazoned above it in English and Arabic.",女性能拯救世界吗？一个醉酒的惊奇队长(Captain Marvel)就能把我们从星际敌人手中拯救出来，但在这地球上，一种新的女性领导模式正在形成。一年前，新西兰总理杰茜达·阿德恩(Jacinda Ardern)作为在任期内生下宝宝的世界领导人而闻名。此后，发生了基督城清真寺屠杀事件，一夜之间，她带着头巾、棱角分明的面孔流露出的庄重，成为了国际社会人性的标志形象。随着新西兰各地的女性带上头巾效仿她的团结姿态时，阿拉伯世界注意到了这一点。在世界第一高楼迪拜哈利法塔(Burj Khalifa)上，打出了阿德恩的巨幅肖像，上方用英语和阿拉伯语写着“和平”一词。
"Countries from Georgia to Ethiopia have recently elected their first female presidents. Women now lead industries where once the thin air was inhaled only by men. For the first time, women have the top jobs at the New York Stock Exchange and at Nasdaq. With the ascension of Kathy Warden to C.E.O. of Northrop Grumman in January, four out of five of America’s biggest defense companies are run by women. Chicago is about to get its first black female mayor, and the Democratic leading light Stacey Abrams just drew a line in the sand when she squelched the idea of running for vice president with the crisp rejoinder, “You don’t run for second place.”",从格鲁吉亚到埃塞俄比亚，多个国家近期选出了它们的第一位女总统。如今，女性担任领导的行业曾一度只有男性的身影。有史以来第一次，女性在纽约证券交易所(New York Stock Exchange)和纳斯达克(Nasdaq)占据了最高职位。随着凯西·沃登(Kathy Warden)1月份荣升诺思罗普-格鲁曼公司(Northrop Grumman)的首席执行官，5家美国最大国防企业中，有4家是由女性领导。芝加哥即将迎来首位黑人女市长，民主党领袖斯泰西·阿布拉姆(Stacey Abrams)不久前表明立场，用一句干脆的回应打消了让她竞选副总统的念头，“要选就选正职。”
"Among the 42 new women sworn into Congress, young rock stars like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez electrify all of us with their passion and verve, but it’s Nancy Pelosi — mother of five, grandmother of nine — who knows how to make the tangerine toddler in the White House eat his spinach. It’s salutatory to watch her corral her rebellious Democratic brood with committee treats and pacifying timeouts. “Be calm. Take a deep breath. Don’t become like them,” she told her angry caucus in an emotional post-Mueller strategy session.",在国会宣誓就职的42名新女性中，像亚历山德里娅·奥卡西奥-科尔特兹(Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez)这样年轻的政坛明星，以其热情与活力令我们所有人为之一振，而正是南希·佩洛西(Nancy Pelosi)——5个孩子的母亲、9个孩子的祖母——最懂得如何让白宫那位橙色男童乖乖吃他的菠菜。看着她为了安抚不听话的民主党伙伴，许以委员会职位，让他们平息下来从长计议，令人心生敬意。“保持镇定。深吸一口气。不要成为他们的样子，”她在一次群情激奋的后穆勒战略会议上对愤怒的党团成员说。
"I don’t contend that women are naturally and invariably better at running governments than men. Witness the dismal sight of Theresa May stumbling on the glass cliffs of Dover last week as, for a third time, her Brexit deal went down in defeat. Yes, the British prime minister may have been better destined to be deputy headmistress of a girls’ school in some provincial city like Salisbury, measuring the length of her pupils’ skirts with a ruler. But the 13 Tory grandees — all male, all white — who descended on Chequers to browbeat Mrs. May yet again this month were described by a bitter London Remainer friend of mine as “bogus patriots in crumpled suits and yesterday’s underpants, loving the sound of their own voices.” Plus Mrs. May found herself in No. 10 Downing Street only because these same feckless upper-class men decided to kiss off the European Union without a clue how to achieve it.",我并不认为女性天生比男性更擅长管理政府。看看特丽莎·梅(Theresa May)上周多佛玻璃悬崖上跌跌撞撞的悲惨景象——她的脱欧方案第三次遭到挫败。是的，这位英国首相可能注定更适合在索尔兹伯里(Salisbury)这样的地方城市当一名女校的副校长，拿着尺子量学生裙子的长度。但本月再度突访契克斯别墅(Chequers)威逼特丽莎·梅的那13位保守党大佬——全为白人男性——被我伦敦一位嘴毒的留欧派友人形容为“穿着皱巴巴的西装和昨天没换的底裤、爱听自己说话声的假爱国者”。另外，特丽莎·梅入主唐宁街10号也是因为这些无能的上流男士决定跟欧盟一刀两断，却又不知道该怎样怎么实现这个目标。
"At a minimum, we can at least argue that women are afflicted by what Hillary Clinton, who has spent a lifetime with someone who lacks it, once called “the responsibility gene.” I can bet a bucket of Bitcoins that we’ll never learn that any of the four married women plausibly seeking the Democratic presidential nomination are secretly sexting pictures of parts of their anatomy to a boyfriend.",至少，我们可以说，女性受到了希拉里·克林顿(Hillary Clinton)所说的“责任基因”的困扰，她一生都和缺乏这种基因的人生活在一起。我敢拿一桶比特币打赌，我们永远也不会发现，在四位角逐民主党总统候选人提名的已婚女性中，有谁会偷偷向男友发送自己身体部位的色情照片。
"But there is a deep lesson here. During thousands of years of civilization, women have evolved to deal with the intractable perplexities of life and find means of peaceful coexistence where men have traditionally found roads to conflict. Women have accumulated rich ways of knowing that until recently were dismissed in male circles of power. The alchemy of what has made women the way they are is mysterious: Is it a result of centuries spent trying to survive and prosper in societies where they’ve been viewed as lesser? Or, until recently, of always being appointed the family caregiver, bearing and raising children, tending to elderly parents and disabled siblings, so often left to shoulder the unpaid burdens of real life? Women have learned and taught lessons about how to cope with seeming impossibilities in ways that men traditionally — and to this day — have not. Coaching a slow learner on homework after a day of hassles at the office provides a deep experience of delayed gratification. A woman’s wisdom comes, in part, from the great juggle of her life.",但这里有一个深刻的教训。历经几千年的文明，女性进化为专门处理生活中种种棘手的困惑，并在传统上由男人制造冲突的地方找到和平共处的手段。女性积累了直到最近还被男性权力圈摒弃的丰富知识。女性之所以成为今天的样子，其中的法术颇为神秘：这是几个世纪来女性在社会中被视为不那么重要的领域努力生存发展的结果吗？或者是因为，直到前不久，女人还总是被任命为家庭的看护者，需要抚养和培育孩子，照顾年迈的父母和残疾的兄弟姐妹，经常被留下来承担现实生活中不需支付报酬的负担？女性已经学习并传授了一些经验教训，如何以男性传统上不会——而且直到今天还没学会——的方式来处理看似不可能的事情。在办公室处理完一天的麻烦后，再来辅导一个脑子慢的学生做家庭作业，可以让人体会到强烈的延迟满足感。女人的智慧部分来自于她生活中必须同时应付许多事情。
"Until very recently, that kind of wisdom was banished to folkways or deprecated as secondary. But as women step into their new roles, the value of that wisdom is beginning to emerge in unexpected ways. Sometimes, it’s a viral cultural moment that reminds us. Who will forget the image of the stoically seated CBS anchor Gayle King intoning in a soothing tone “Robert, Robert” to a flailing, weeping, lying R. Kelly?",直到前不久，这种智慧还被贬低为民俗或者次要。但随着女性步入新的角色，这种智慧的价值开始以意想不到的方式显现出来。有时，一个病毒式传播的文化时刻会提醒我们。谁会忘记CBS主播盖尔·金(Gayle King)坚忍地坐在那里，用安抚的语气对哭着挥舞手臂、满嘴谎言的R·凯利(R. Kelly)说“罗伯特，罗伯特”的画面?
"It’s past time for women to stop trying to cram themselves into outdated NASA spacesuits designed for an alien masculine physique. Salvation doesn’t lie in pursuing traditional male paths of ejaculatory self-elevation. In drawing on women’s wisdom without apology and pushing that wisdom forward into positions of power, we can soothe our world and, maybe, even save it.",现在，女性不该再努力把自己塞进过时的NASA宇航服里了，它们是专为不相容的男性体格设计的。拯救并不在于追求射精式自我提升的传统男性道路。如果能够坦然地汲取女性的智慧，并把这种智慧推向权力的位置，我们便可以安抚我们的世界，甚至可以拯救它。
"HONG KONG — Chief Justice Zhou Qiang, China’s top judicial official, is hardly a radical reformer. But to liberal-minded watchers of the country’s evolving court system, he has nonetheless been an encouraging figure.",香港——中国高级司法官员、最高人民法院院长周强算不上是一个激进的改革者。但在对这个国家不断发展的法院制度有所观察、那些支持变革人士的眼中，他仍是一个令人感到乐观的人物。
"In recent years, he has spearheaded an effort to make China’s judiciary, which is subordinate to the ruling Communist Party, more professional. He has pushed to weed out poorly trained judges and to raise the pay of those with formal legal training, which often includes a heavy dose of Western jurisprudence.",近年来，他已带头努力把隶属于执政的共产党的中国司法部门变得更加专业化。他已推动了一些做法，包括把缺乏训练的法官清理出去、同时为那些受过正式法律培训的法官提高薪酬，这种培训通常包括大量的西方法学。
"So when the chief justice used warlike language on Saturday to denounce the idea of an independent judiciary and other cherished liberal principles, warning judges not to fall into the “trap” of “Western” ideology, observers in China and abroad were shocked and dismayed.",所以，当上周六，这位最高人民法院院长用好战的言辞谴责了司法独立概念及其他人们钟爱的自由主义原则、警告法官不要陷入“西方”意识形态的“陷阱”时，中国和国外的观察者们都感到震惊和失望。
"“We should resolutely resist erroneous influence from the West: ‘constitutional democracy,’ ‘separation of powers’ and ‘independence of the judiciary,’” Chief Justice Zhou, the head of the Supreme People’s Court of China, said in a speech to a group of legal officials in Beijing. “We must make clear our stand and dare to show the sword.”",最高人民法院院长周强在北京对一些法官发表讲话时说，“要坚决抵制西方‘宪政民主’、‘三权分立’、‘司法独立’等错误思潮影响，旗帜鲜明，敢于亮剑。”
"The speech was widely seen as a bow to the strict political climate that President Xi Jinping has established in China, as a major Communist Party conclave approaches this year. Though Mr. Xi won plaudits this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, for his support of economic globalization, at home he has overseen a yearslong program to constrain civil society, promote adulation for Mao Zedong, stamp out support for an independent press and sharply limit speech on the internet.",随着中国共产党今年的全国代表大会即将召开，他的这番讲话，被广泛认为是受迫于国家主席习近平在中国建立起来的严峻政治气氛而作出的。虽然本周，在瑞士达沃斯举行的世界经济论坛上，习近平因支持经济全球化而赢得了称赞，但他在国内一直在监督一项旷日持久的行动的开展，约束公民社会，提倡吹捧毛泽东，打压对独立出版的支持，并大幅限制互联网上的言论。
"“This statement is the most enormous ideological setback for decades of halting, uneven progress toward the creation of a professional, impartial judiciary,” Jerome A. Cohen, director of the U.S.-Asia Law Institute at New York University, wrote of the chief justice’s speech in a blog post. “It has already provoked some of China’s most admirable legal scholars to speak out in defiance, and, despite their prominence, I fear not only for their academic freedom and careers but also for their personal safety.”",纽约大学亚美法研究所所长孔杰荣(Jerome A. Cohen)在一篇针对周强讲话的博客文章中写道，“对朝着建立一个专业、公正的司法系统所做出的断断续续、不均衡的进步来说，这种说法是几十年来的最大的意识形态挫折。它已经引起中国一些最令人钦佩的法律学者的公开反对，尽管他们享有盛名，我却不仅为他们的学术自由和职业担心，也为他们的人身安全感到担忧。”
"One Chinese scholar who spoke out was He Weifang, a law professor at Peking University, whose own online post criticizing the remarks was removed from the internet. In the post, he said it was wrong to call judicial independence a Western concept, citing the example of Bao Zheng, a famous Chinese judge who lived about 1,000 years ago and was celebrated for his just decisions.",一位公开表态的中国学者是北京大学法学教授贺卫方，他自己发表于网上、批评周强讲话的文章现已被删除。在那篇文章中，贺卫方说，把司法独立称为西方概念是错误的，还引用了包拯的例子，包拯是约一千年前一位著名的中国法官，因其判案公正而垂名青史。
"“This is truly a statement that wrecks the nation and harms the people,” Mr. He wrote. “It truly goes against history.”",贺卫方写道，“（这）是真正的祸国殃民的言行，完全是在开历史的倒车。”
"In a telephone interview on Tuesday, Mr. He said Mr. Xi’s comments at a Communist Party work conference two days before the chief justice’s speech had made it clear that he was demanding obedience from the judiciary.",在周二的电话采访中，贺卫方说，在最高人民法院院长讲话的两天前，习近平在共产党的一个工作会议上说的话表明，他要求司法部门唯命是从。
"“Xi said some very harsh things,” Mr. He said. “He demanded that political and legal work must safeguard the stability of the regime. So now heads of these judicial organizations must declare where they stand, to show that they support what Xi said.”",“习在会上讲了一些很激烈的话，”贺卫方说。“要求政法工作要维护政权稳定。那现在下面这些司法机关的首长都必须要表态，表达对习这样一种说法的拥护。”
"In his speech Saturday, Chief Justice Zhou also exhorted judges to “safeguard by law images of leaders and heroes, and to resolutely safeguard the party and the People’s Army’s glorious history.”",在周六的讲话中，最高人民法院院长周强敦促法官“依法维护领袖、英烈形象，坚决捍卫党和人民军队的光辉历史。”
"Mr. Cohen said that remark was consistent with Mr. Xi’s effort to whitewash the image of Mao, Communist China’s first leader. Since 2013, the Communist Party has spoken out against the notion of “historical nihilism,” which it takes to mean any denigration of the historical image of Mao and the party, including discussion of Mao’s disastrous economic policies in the late 1950s or his chaotic Cultural Revolution.",孔杰荣说，上述言论与习近平粉饰毛泽东形象的努力相一致，毛泽东是共产党统治中国后的首位领导人。自2013年起，共产党就在反对“历史虚无主义”的概念，共产党把“历史虚无主义”解释为任何对毛泽东和党的历史形象的诋毁，包括对毛泽东在1950年代后期的灾难性经济政策、或他发动的混乱的文化大革命的讨论。
"In recent weeks, the government has cracked down harshly on some officials who made negative remarks about Mao. In the northern province of Hebei, a deputy director of the Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television Bureau in the provincial capital was fired after making what were deemed “erroneous comments” on his social media account, which has since been deleted. Overseas Chinese websites reported that the comments were critical of Mao.",在最近几周里，政府严厉打击了一些对毛泽东发表了负面评论的官员。在北方的河北省，省会城市文化广电新闻出版局副局长被解除职务，此前他在社交媒体帐户上发表了被认为是“错误的言论”，他的帐户现已被删除。海外中文网站报道说，那些言论批评了毛泽东。
"While his position is prestigious, Chief Justice Zhou is not a member of the Communist Party’s ruling Politburo. Before Mr. Xi’s ascension to power in 2012, the jurist was a rising star, serving as the top official in Hunan, Mao’s home province. He was frequently mentioned as a possible candidate for a top leadership position.",虽然周强身居要职，但他不是共产党主持政府的政治局的成员。在习近平2012年上台之前，周强曾是一位上升的明星，在毛泽东的家乡湖南担任最高官员。人们曾经常提到他可能是一个高级领导职位的候选人。
"Now he is showing his fealty to Mr. Xi, Mr. Cohen, the director of the U.S.-Asia Law Institute, said in a telephone interview. He said the speech appeared to be a bid for political survival before the Communist Party Congress set for late this year, which will determine who serves directly under Mr. Xi for the next five years.",亚美法研究所所长孔杰荣在电话采访中说，现在周强正在宣誓效忠习近平。孔杰荣说，周强的这番讲话，看来是在共产党全国代表大会召开之前，争取政治生存的表现，党代会将决定谁会在未来五年里直接在习近平手下工作，将于今年晚些时候召开。
"“People who know him find him a reasonable person who’s had a good legal education and who had been open before he became chief justice to improvements in the legal system,” Mr. Cohen said. “This must be pretty bitter gruel for him to swallow in order to try to bring the courts into a kind of militant observance of the highest party leadership.”",“认识他的人觉得他是一个有头脑的人，他受过良好的法律教育，在他成为最高法院院长之前，对改善法律制度持开放的态度，”孔杰荣说。“要试图让法院对党的最高领导有一种战士般的遵从，这对他来说，一定是需要吞到肚子里的苦水。”
"WASHINGTON — As President Trump met with advisers in the Oval Office in May 2017 to discuss replacements for the F.B.I. director he had just fired, Attorney General Jeff Sessions slipped out of the room to take a call.",华盛顿——2017年5月，特朗普总统在椭圆形办公室跟顾问们开会，讨论刚刚被他解雇的联邦调查局局长的接替人选，司法部长杰夫·塞申斯(Jeff Sessions)溜出房间接了个电话。
"When he came back, he gave Mr. Trump bad news: Robert S. Mueller III had just been appointed as a special counsel to take over the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election and any actions by the president to impede it.",当他回来时，他给特朗普带来一个坏消息：罗伯特·S·穆勒三世(Robert S. Mueller III)刚刚被任命为特别检察官，负责调查俄罗斯干预2016年总统大选，以及总统是否存在任何阻挠的行动。
"Mr. Trump slumped in his chair. “Oh, my God,” he said. “This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I’m fucked.”",特朗普瘫坐在椅子上。“天呐，”他说，“这太可怕了。我要下台了。完蛋。”
"It has not been the end of his presidency, but it has come to consume it. Although the resulting two-year investigation ended without charges against Mr. Trump, Mr. Mueller’s report painted a damning portrait of a White House dominated by a president desperate to thwart the inquiry only to be restrained by aides equally desperate to thwart his orders.",他的任期并没有结束，但也火烧眉毛了。尽管随后两年的调查在结束时并没有对特朗普提出任何指控，但穆勒的报告描绘了一幅不堪的画面：白宫被一个拼命阻挠调查的总统所控制，结果却受制于那些同样拼命阻挠其命令的助手们。
"The White House that emerges from more than 400 pages of Mr. Mueller’s report is a hotbed of conflict infused by a culture of dishonesty — defined by a president who lies to the public and his own staff, then tries to get his aides to lie for him. Mr. Trump repeatedly threatened to fire lieutenants who did not carry out his wishes while they repeatedly threatened to resign rather than cross lines of propriety or law.",从400多页的穆勒报告中浮现出来的白宫，是一个充斥不诚实文化的冲突温床。定义这个文化的，是一个向公众和自己的手下撒谎，然后还想让助手替他撒谎的总统。特朗普曾多次威胁要解雇那些不听话的手下，而他们也多次以辞职来威胁，不愿逾越规矩和法律的界限。
"At one juncture after another, Mr. Trump made his troubles worse, giving in to anger and grievance and lashing out in ways that turned advisers into witnesses against him. He was saved from an accusation of obstruction of justice, the report makes clear, in part because aides saw danger and stopped him from following his own instincts. Based on contemporaneous notes, emails, texts and F.B.I. interviews, the report draws out scene after scene of a White House on the edge.",在一个又一个的关键时刻，特朗普让自己在麻烦中越陷越深，他被愤怒和委屈吞没，因为大发雷霆而把顾问变成了对自己不利的证人。报告明确指出，他之所以免于妨碍司法的指控，部分原因正是他的助手们看到了危险，阻止了他凭直觉行事。根据当时的笔记、电子邮件、短信和联邦调查局的约谈，这份报告描绘了白宫一个又一个陷入水深火热的场景。
"At one point, Reince Priebus, then the White House chief of staff, said the president’s attacks on his own attorney general meant that he had “D.O.J. by the throat.” At another, the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, complained to Mr. Priebus that the president was trying to get him to “do crazy shit.” Mr. Trump was equally unhappy with Mr. McGahn, calling him a “lying bastard.”",时任白宫幕僚长的雷恩斯·普利巴斯(Reince Priebus)曾经表示，总统对他自己的司法部长的攻击，意味着他“掐住了司法部的喉咙”。在另一个场合，白宫的法律顾问唐纳德·F·麦格恩二世(Donald F. McGahn II)向普利巴斯抱怨，总统想让他“做疯狂的事情”。特朗普对麦格恩也感到不满，称他是“撒谎的混蛋”。
‘We’ll Take Care of You’,“我们会关照你的”
"From its first days, Mr. Trump’s presidency struggled to contain the threat stemming from Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and suspicions about his team’s contacts with Moscow.",上任伊始，特朗普就一直在竭力遏制俄罗斯干预2016年大选一事构成的威胁，以及外界对他的团队与莫斯科方面进行接触的怀疑。
"Just weeks after taking office, Mr. Trump pushed out his national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who lied to the F.B.I. about his conversations with Russia’s ambassador.",上任刚刚几周，特朗普就让他的国家安全顾问迈克尔·T·弗林(Michael T. Flynn)走人。弗林在与俄罗斯大使谈话的问题上对联邦调查局撒了谎。
"But Mr. Trump hugged Mr. Flynn, telling him: “We’ll give you a good recommendation. You’re a good guy. We’ll take care of you.”",但特朗普拥抱了弗林，告诉他：“我们会给你写一封很好的推荐信。你是个好人。我们会关照你的。”
"Mr. Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, mistakenly assumed that getting rid of Mr. Flynn would derail the investigation then being led by James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director. During lunch with Chris Christie, then the governor of New Jersey, Mr. Flynn called and Mr. Kushner spoke with him.",特朗普和他的女婿贾里德·库什纳(Jared Kushner)误以为，除掉弗林会破坏当时由联邦调查局局长詹姆斯·B·科米(James B. Comey)领导的调查。在与当时的新泽西州州长克里斯·克里斯蒂(Chris Christie)共进午餐时，弗林给他打去电话，由库什纳与他进行了交谈。
"“The president cares about you,” Mr. Kushner told Mr. Flynn. “I’ll get the president to send out a positive tweet about you later.”",“总统很关心你，”库什纳对弗林说。“我稍后会让总统发一条关于你的正面推文。”
"Mr. Trump was worried about Mr. Comey, too. During the lunch, he asked Mr. Christie to call Mr. Comey, a friend. “Tell him he’s part of the team,” Mr. Trump instructed.",特朗普也担心科米。午饭时，他让克里斯蒂给他的朋友科米打电话。“告诉他，他是团队的一员，”特朗普嘱咐道。
Mr. Christie thought the president’s request was “nonsensical” and never followed through.,克里斯蒂认为总统的要求是“荒谬的”，他始终没有照办。
"Other advisers feared Mr. Trump was not telling the truth to the public. After a news conference at which he denied any business dealings in Russia, Michael D. Cohen, then the president’s personal lawyer who had been trying to arrange a Trump Tower in Moscow, expressed concern.",有的顾问则担心特朗普没有向公众说实话。在他否认与俄罗斯有任何商业往来的新闻发布会后，总统当时的私人律师、曾试图在莫斯科建造一座特朗普大厦的迈克尔·D·科恩(Michael D. Cohen)表达了担忧。
Mr. Trump said that the project had not yet been finalized. “Why mention it if it is not a deal?” he said.,特朗普表示，该项目尚未最终敲定。“如果没有达成一笔交易，为什么要提这件事？”他说。
‘You Left Me on an Island’,“你把我丢在了孤岛上”
"With the investigation bearing down on him, Mr. Trump wanted to make sure Mr. Sessions remained in charge at the Justice Department, and he asked Mr. McGahn to tell the attorney general not to recuse himself because of his work on the Trump campaign. Mr. McGahn tried to head off a recusal by calling the attorney general three times, but Mr. Sessions announced his recusal that afternoon.",随着调查的压力越来越大，特朗普希望确保塞申斯继续执掌司法部，他要求麦格恩告诉司法部长，不要因为他在特朗普竞选活动中的工作而回避。麦格恩曾三次打电话给司法部长，试图阻止塞申斯的回避，但塞申斯当天下午宣布了回避。
"Mr. Trump was furious. Summoning Mr. McGahn to the Oval Office the next day, he said, “I don’t have a lawyer,” and added that he wished Roy Cohn, the famed bare-knuckled attorney who once worked for him in New York, was still his lawyer. Mr. Trump said that Robert F. Kennedy protected John F. Kennedy, and Eric H. Holder Jr. protected Barack Obama.",特朗普非常愤怒。第二天，他把麦格恩叫到椭圆形办公室，说，“我没有律师。”他说，他希望曾在纽约为他工作的著名律师罗伊·科恩(Roy Cohn)仍然担任自己的律师。特朗普还说，罗伯特·F·肯尼迪(Robert F. Kennedy)保护了约翰·F·肯尼迪(John F. Kennedy)，小埃里克·H·霍尔德(Eric H. Holder Jr.)保护了贝拉克·奥巴马(Barack Obama)。
“You’re telling me that Bobby and Jack didn’t talk about investigations?” he demanded. “Or Obama didn’t tell Eric Holder who to investigate?”,“你是说鲍比和杰克没有谈过调查？”他问。“或者奥巴马没有告诉埃里克·霍尔德该去调查谁？”
"Mr. Trump screamed at Mr. McGahn about how weak Mr. Sessions was, and Stephen K. Bannon, then the president’s chief strategist, thought he was as mad as he had ever seen him.",特朗普对麦格恩大吼，抱怨塞申斯有多软弱，时任总统首席策略师史蒂芬·K·班农(Stephen K. Bannon)说，这是他记忆里特朗普最狂怒的一刻。
"The president asked Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, if he could do anything to rebut news stories on the Russia matter. The admiral’s deputy, Richard Ledgett, who was present for the call, considered it the most unusual experience of his 40 years in government and prepared a memo describing the call that he and Admiral Rogers signed and put in a safe.",总统询问美国国家安全局(National Security Agency)局长、海军上将迈克尔·S·罗杰斯(Michael S. Rogers)，问他是否能做些什么来反驳有关俄罗斯问题的新闻报道。海军上将的副手理查德·莱吉特(Richard Ledgett)当时在场，他认为这是他在政府任职40年来最不寻常的经历，并准备了一份备忘录，描述了那次会面，他和罗杰斯上将都在上面签了字并放入保险箱。
"Mr. Trump groused about the Russia investigation with his intelligence chiefs on multiple other occasions. At one point, Admiral Rogers recalled a private conversation in which the president said something like the “Russia thing has got to go away.” But the intelligence chiefs said they did not feel pressured to take specific actions.",特朗普在其他多个场合向情报部门领导人表达对俄罗斯调查的不满。罗杰斯上将回忆起一次私人谈话，当时总统说了一些“俄罗斯的事情必须消失”之类的话。但情报部门领导人们表示，他们没有感到采取具体行动的压力。
"Mr. Trump increasingly focused his ire on Mr. Comey, who during testimony on Capitol Hill on May 3, 2017, refused to answer questions about whether the president himself was under investigation.",特朗普越来越把怒火集中在科米身上。2017年5月3日，科米在国会山作证时拒绝回答有关总统本人是否正在接受调查的问题。
"Angry, Mr. Trump wheeled on Mr. Sessions. “This is terrible, Jeff,” he said. “It’s all because you recused.” He added: “You left me on an island. I can’t do anything.”",特朗普愤怒地转向塞申斯。“这太可怕了，杰夫，”他说。“这都是因为你逃避责任。”他还说：“你把我丢在了孤岛上。我什么也做不了。”
"Mr. Sessions said he had no choice, but said that a new start at the F.B.I. would be appropriate and that the president should consider replacing Mr. Comey.",塞申斯说，他别无选择，但他表示，联邦调查局应当有一个新的开始，总统应该考虑替换科米。
"Mr. Trump was fixated on the F.B.I. director. Mr. Bannon recalled that he brought up Mr. Comey at least eight times on May 3 and May 4. “He told me three times I’m not under investigation,” the president said. “He’s a showboater. He’s a grandstander. I don’t know any Russians. There was no collusion.”",特朗普一直格外关注科米。班农回忆说，在5月3日和4日，他至少有八次提到科米。“他三次告诉我，我没有受到调查，”总统说。“他是做给人看。他是在卖弄他的把戏。我不认识俄罗斯人。没有什么共谋。”
Mr. Bannon told Mr. Trump that he could not fire Mr. Comey because “that ship has sailed” and that it would not stop the investigation.,班农对特朗普说，他不能撤科米，因为“已经错过了那个时机”，撤了也不会停止调查。
‘The Beginning of the End?’,“终结的起点？”
"Mr. Trump ignored the advice and fired Mr. Comey on May 9, justifying it on criticism of his investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email the year before. Overruling objections by Mr. McGahn and Mr. Priebus, Mr. Trump insisted that the letter firing the F.B.I. director state that Mr. Comey told him three times the president was not under investigation.",特朗普无视这一建议，于5月9日将科米撤职，理由是他对前一年调查希拉里·克林顿(Hillary Clinton)电子邮件的批评。特朗普驳回了麦格恩和普利巴斯的反对意见，坚持在将联邦调查局局长免职的信中声称，科米曾三次告诉自己，总统没有受到调查。
"Aides were alarmed. “Is this the beginning of the end?” Annie Donaldson, Mr. McGahn’s chief of staff, wrote in her notes.",助手们十分警觉。“这会是终结的起点吗？”麦格恩的幕僚长安妮·唐纳森(Annie Donaldson)在笔记中写道。
"Sarah Huckabee Sanders, then the president’s deputy press secretary, told reporters that the White House had talked to “countless members of the F.B.I.” who supported the decision to fire the director — but she later admitted to investigators that it was not true. Her comment, she said, was “a slip of the tongue” made “in the heat of the moment” and not founded on anything.",当时总统的副新闻秘书萨拉·赫卡比·桑德斯(Sarah Huckabee Sanders)告诉记者，白宫已经与“无数的联邦调查局成员”进行了交谈，他们都支持解雇局长的决定。但她后来向调查人员承认，这不是真的。她说，她的评论是“一时冲动”之下的“口误”，没有任何依据。
"Mr. Comey’s dismissal led the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, to appoint Mr. Mueller, a former F.B.I. director, to take over the investigation. Fearing it would mean the end of his presidency, Mr. Trump lashed out again at Mr. Sessions.",科米被解职后，司法部副部长罗德·J·罗森斯坦(Rod J. Rosenstein)任命前联邦调查局局长穆勒接手调查。特朗普担心这意味着他总统任期的终结，于是再次猛烈抨击塞申斯。
"“How could you let this happen, Jeff?” he demanded. He told Mr. Sessions, “You were supposed to protect me,” or words to that effect.",“杰夫，你怎么能让这种事发生呢？”他问道。他对塞申斯说，“你应该保护我”，或者诸如此类的话。
"“Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels, it ruins your presidency,” he added. “It takes years and years, and I won’t be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.”",“所有人都告诉我，如果你摊上这样一个独立检察官，你的总统生涯就毁了，”他还说。“这会耗上很多年，我什么也干不了。我还从来没遇到过这么差劲的事。”
"Mr. Trump demanded that his attorney general resign. Mr. Sessions said he would, and he returned to the Oval Office the next day with a resignation letter he handed to Mr. Trump.",特朗普要求他的司法部长辞职。塞申斯说他会的，第二天他回到椭圆形办公室，把辞职信交给了特朗普。
"The president put the letter in his pocket and repeatedly asked Mr. Sessions whether he wanted to continue serving as attorney general. When Mr. Sessions finally said he did, the president said he wanted him to stay. The two shook hands, but Mr. Trump kept the letter.",总统把信放在口袋里，反复问塞申斯是否愿意继续担任司法部长。最后塞申斯说他愿意，总统也说自己希望他留下来。两人握了手，但特朗普保留了这封信。
"When they learned about the letter, Mr. Priebus and Mr. Bannon worried that if he kept it, Mr. Trump could use it to improperly influence Mr. Sessions; it would, said Mr. Priebus, serve as a “shock collar” keeping the attorney general on a leash.",得知这封信的时候，普利巴斯和班农担心，如果特朗普保存了这封信，就可能会利用它不当地影响塞申斯；普利巴斯说，它会成为一个“电击项圈”，把司法部长掌握在自己手上。
"The next day, May 19, Mr. Trump left the White House for the Middle East. On Air Force One flying from Saudi Arabia to Israel three days later, the president took the letter from his pocket and showed it off to aides. Later on the trip, when Mr. Priebus asked Mr. Trump for the letter, the president claimed he did not have it and it was actually back at the White House.",第二天，5月19日，特朗普离开白宫前往中东。三天后，在从沙特阿拉伯飞往以色列的“空军一号”上，总统从口袋里拿出这封信，向助手们展示。在随后的行程中，当普利巴斯向特朗普索要这封信时，总统声称信留在白宫，不在自己手头。
"Three days after the president returned to Washington, he finally returned the letter to Mr. Sessions with a note: “Not accepted.”",总统回到华盛顿三天后，终于把信退回给塞申斯，并附了一张便条：“不接受。”
"But he did not give up trying to regain control of the investigation, calling Mr. Sessions at home to ask if he would “unrecuse” himself and direct the Justice Department to prosecute Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Sessions refused.",但他没有放弃重新控制调查的努力，他打电话给塞申斯，询问他是否会“撤回回避”，并指示司法部起诉克林顿。塞申斯拒绝了。
‘Mueller Has to Go’,“穆勒必须走人”
"If the attorney general would not rein in the special counsel, Mr. Trump resolved to find someone who would. On June 17, Mr. Trump called Mr. McGahn from Camp David and told him to have Mr. Rosenstein fire Mr. Mueller because of conflicts of interest.",司法部长不愿控制特别检察官，特朗普决定找个人来控制他。6月17日，特朗普从戴维营给麦格恩打了电话，让他要求罗森斯坦以利益冲突为由解雇穆勒。
"During a 23-minute conversation, Mr. Trump said something along the lines of: “You got to do this. You got to call Rod.” Mr. McGahn, who along with other advisers believed that the supposed conflicts were “silly” and “not real,” was perturbed by the call.",在23分钟的谈话中，特朗普说了一些类似这样的话：“你必须这么做。你得给罗德打电话。”麦格恩和其他顾问都认为，这些所谓的冲突是“愚蠢的”、“不实的”。这通电话令他们很不安。
"The president then called again. “Mueller has to go,” he told Mr. McGahn. “Call me back when you do it.”",然后总统又打来了。“穆勒必须走人，”他对麦格恩说。“你搞定这件事再给我回电话。”
"Mr. McGahn decided he would resign, determined not to repeat the experience of Robert H. Bork, who complied with President Richard M. Nixon’s order to fire the Watergate prosecutor during the Saturday Night Massacre before going on to serve as an appeals court judge.",麦格恩不想重蹈罗伯特·H·博克(Robert H. Bork)的覆辙，决定辞职——在担任上诉法院法官之前，博克遵守了理查德·M·尼克松(Richard M. Nixon)总统的命令，在“周六晚大屠杀”事件中解雇了水门事件的检察官。
"Mr. McGahn, saying that he wanted to be more like Judge Bork and not “Saturday Night Massacre Bork,” drove to the office to pack his possessions and submit his resignation. When Mr. McGahn told Mr. Priebus and Mr. Bannon, they urged him not to resign and he backed off.",麦格恩说，他更想效仿法官博克，而不是“周六晚大屠杀”中的博克。当麦格恩通知普利巴斯和班农时，他们敦促他不要辞职，于是他放弃了。
"Undeterred, Mr. Trump summoned his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, to the White House two days later and dictated a message for him to deliver to Mr. Sessions that would have effectively limited the scope of the investigation to Russian interference in the 2016 election.",特朗普没有被吓倒，两天后，他把前竞选经理科里·莱万多夫斯基(Corey Lewandowski)叫到白宫，并让他向塞申斯传达一条信息，可以有效地将调查范围限制在俄罗斯干预2016年大选。
"In the message, Mr. Trump ordered Mr. Sessions to give a speech declaring that Mr. Trump was “being treated very unfairly” by the investigation.",在这则信息中，特朗普命令塞申斯发言宣称该调查令特朗普“受到了非常不公平的对待”。
"“He shouldn’t have a Special Prosecutor/Counsel b/c he hasn’t done anything wrong,” Mr. Sessions was to say. “I was on the campaign w/him for nine months, there were no Russians involved with him. I know it for a fact b/c I was there. He didn’t do anything wrong except he ran the greatest campaign in American history.”",“不应该有一个特别检察官来调查他，因为他没做错什么，”塞申斯被要求这样说。“我和他一起参加了九个月的竞选活动，没有俄罗斯人参与。我知道这是事实，因为我就在那儿。他没有做错任何事，只是进行了美国历史上最伟大的竞选活动。”
"A scheduling conflict scotched the meeting, but Mr. Trump raised it again a month later, saying that if Mr. Sessions did not meet, Mr. Lewandowski should tell him he was fired. Mr. Lewandowski assured him that the message would be delivered.",由于日程安排冲突，会面未能如期举行，但特朗普在一个月后再次提起这件事，称如果塞申斯不会面，那么莱万多夫斯基应该告诉他，他被解雇了。莱万多夫斯基向他保证，他会转达这一信息。
"Hours later, the president criticized the attorney general in an interview with The New York Times. While the meeting with Mr. Lewandowski was never held, Mr. Sessions understood his tenuous position and carried a letter of resignation in his pocket every time he visited the White House.",几个小时后，总统在接受《纽约时报》采访时批评了司法部长。虽然从未与莱万多夫斯基见过面，但塞申斯明白自己的处境岌岌可危，每次去白宫时口袋里都揣着辞职信。
‘Boss Man Worried’,“老板很担心”
"In late June, presidential advisers and lawyers learned about a Trump Tower meeting with Russians during the campaign hosted by Donald Trump Jr., along with Mr. Kushner and Paul Manafort, the campaign chairman. But the president said he did not want to hear about it.",6月底，总统的顾问和律师了解到大选期间在特朗普大厦(Trump Tower)跟俄罗斯人有过一次会面，主持的是小唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump Jr.)，以及库什纳和竞选团队主席保罗·马纳福特(Paul Manafort)。但总统表示，他不想听到此事。
"A few days later, at the office of Mr. Kushner’s lawyer, Hope Hicks, the president’s communications adviser, saw emails about setting up the meeting and offering “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton on behalf of the Russian government. In a meeting, Mr. Kushner played down the encounter with the Russians, telling the president it was about adoption.",几天后，在库什纳律师的办公室，总统的新闻秘书霍普·希克斯(Hope Hicks)看了有关安排此次会面，以及代表俄罗斯政府提供克林顿“黑料”的邮件。在一次会议上，库什纳淡化了碰见俄罗斯人一事，跟总统说那是谈关于领养问题的。
"Ms. Hicks suggested getting ahead of the story by having Donald Trump Jr. release the emails as part of an interview with “softball questions.” She warned that the emails were “really bad” and the story would be “massive” when it broke, but the president again said he did not want to hear about it.",希克斯建议由小唐纳德·特朗普在就“无关痛痒的问题”接受采访时顺便公开这些邮件，以此抢先应对。她警告，这些邮件“真的很糟糕”，一旦曝出，将“影响巨大”，但总统再次表示他不想听到这件事。
"On July 7, while the president was at the G-20 summit meeting in Germany, Ms. Hicks learned that The Times was preparing a story about the Trump Tower meeting. Ms. Hicks, on the flight home from Germany, recommended disclosing the entire story, but the president rebuffed her, saying a draft statement said too much.",7月7日，总统在德国参加G-20峰会期间，希克斯了解到，时报正在准备有关特朗普大厦会面的报道。在从国内飞往德国的班机上，希克斯建议披露整件事情，但总统断然回绝了她，称声明草案透露了太多内容。
"Instead, Mr. Trump suggested the statement say that his eldest son had attended a meeting about Russian adoptions.",相反，特朗普建议声明称，他的大儿子曾参加过有关收养俄罗斯儿童的会谈。
"Ms. Hicks then texted Donald Trump Jr. a statement asking if that was all right. The president’s son wanted to insert that they “primarily” discussed Russian adoption because, as he texted to Ms. Hicks, they “started with some Hillary thing which was bs and some other nonsense which we shot down fast.”",希克斯于是把声明用短信传给小唐纳德·特朗普，问他是否可行。总统的儿子想加上他们“主要”谈了领养俄罗斯儿童的问题，正如他回复给希克斯的信息，他们“开始谈了希拉里的一些事，都是些废话，然后又说了些没用的，我们很快就给否掉了”。
"Ms. Hicks responded: “I think that’s right too but boss man worried it invites a lot of questions.” The younger Mr. Trump, who urged releasing the emails themselves, finally did once the White House learned that The Times was about to publish them.",希克斯回复称：“我也认为这没问题，但老板担心这可能会招来很多问题。”小特朗普也敦促公开邮件内容，终于在白宫得知时报即将发表邮件时，立即将其公开。
‘I’ll Have to Get Rid of Him’,“我将不得不把他赶走”
"Mr. Trump did not stop pressing Mr. Sessions to take back control of the investigation. On Oct. 16, the president met privately with Mr. Sessions and said he should look again at Mrs. Clinton’s emails. Mr. Sessions made no promises.",特朗普没有停止向塞申斯施压，以夺回调查的控制权。10月16日，总统与塞申斯私下会面，表示他应该再查看一下克林顿的邮件。塞申斯没有做出任何承诺。
"Two days later, the president posted the first of several tweets in the coming weeks complaining that the Justice Department was not investigating Mrs. Clinton. One of the tweets concluded: “DO SOMETHING!”",两天后，总统发了未来数周连发的几条推文中的第一条，抱怨司法部没有在调查克林顿。其中一则推文最后用全大写字母写道：“做点什么！”
"The pressure on the president rose in November when Mr. Flynn’s lawyers told Mr. Trump’s team that he would be accepting a plea deal. One of Mr. Trump’s lawyers left a voice mail message for one of Mr. Flynn’s: “[R]emember what we’ve always said about the president and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains.”",当弗林的律师11月告诉特朗普的团队，他将要接受一份认罪协议时，总统面临的压力增加了。特朗普的一名律师给弗林的一名律师发了一条语音留言：“记得我们一直所说的关于总统的话，还有他对弗林的感情么，这一点依旧没变。”
"On Dec. 6, five days after Mr. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about contacts with the Russian government, Mr. Trump pulled Mr. Sessions aside after a cabinet meeting and again suggested he “unrecuse” himself. “You’d be a hero,” he said, while saying he was not going to “direct you to do anything.”",12月6日，弗林承认有罪，即承认在与俄罗斯政府联络一事上撒谎五天之后，特朗普在一次内阁会议后把塞申斯拉到一边，再度建议他“不要回避”此事。“你会成为英雄的，”他说，同时称他不会“指使你做任何事情。”
"In January 2018, The Times reported about the president’s June 2017 effort to have Mr. Mueller fired. A livid Mr. Trump pressed Mr. McGahn to publicly rebut the story, but he would not because the article accurately reported the president’s desires.",2018年1月，时报报道了总统曾于2017年6月试图让穆勒解职一事。勃然大怒的总统迫使麦格恩公开反驳这一报道，但他以文章准确报道了总统的想法为由未予答应。
"Mr. Trump insisted that Mr. McGahn deny it. “If he doesn’t write a letter, then maybe I’ll have to get rid of him,” the president said, or something to that effect.",特朗普当时坚持要求麦格恩否认此事。“如果他不写信，那我可能就不得不把他赶走，”总统说，或者说了意思差不多的话。
"John F. Kelly, who had replaced Mr. Priebus as chief of staff, then arranged a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. McGahn.",此前已取代普利巴斯担任幕僚长的约翰·F·凯利(John F. Kelly)随后安排特朗普与麦格恩举行了一次会面。
"“I never said to fire Mueller,” Mr. Trump said. “I never said ‘fire.’ This story doesn’t look good. You need to correct this. You’re the White House counsel.”",“我从没说过要解雇穆勒，”特朗普说。“我从没用过‘解雇’这个字眼。这篇报道看上去不妙。你得去更正。你是白宫的法律顾问。”
“Did I say the word ‘fire’?” he asked.,“我说过‘解雇’这个词吗？”他问道。
"“What you said is, ‘Call Rod, tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and can’t be the special counsel,’” Mr. McGahn replied. He refused the president’s request that he “do a correction.”",“你的原话是，‘打电话给罗德，告诉罗德，穆勒存在冲突，不能当特别检察官，’”麦格恩答道。他拒绝了总统让他“予以更正”的要求。
Mr. Trump then complained about Mr. McGahn writing things down. “Why do you take notes? Lawyers don’t take notes. I never had a lawyer who took notes.”,特朗普随即抱怨麦格恩做了记录。“你为什么要记下来？律师都不记笔记。我从来没有一个律师做笔记。”
Mr. McGahn maintained he took notes because he was a “real lawyer” and they create a record.,麦格恩坚称，他记笔记是因为他是个“真正的律师”，他们设立了一个档案。
"“I’ve had a lot of great lawyers, like Roy Cohn,” Mr. Trump said. “He did not take notes.”",“我有过很多很棒的律师，就像罗伊·科恩(Roy Cohn)，”特朗普说，“他就不做笔记。”
But Mr. McGahn did. And so did plenty of others.,但麦格恩记了。许多其他人也这么做了。
"SEOUL, South Korea — It read like typical North Korean propaganda: soldiers toiling on snowy hills near the border with China, racing to finish construction on a tourist resort and making great sacrifices for the glory of the state.",韩国首尔——这篇报道读起来就像是典型的朝鲜宣传：士兵们在中朝边境附近的雪山上辛勤劳动，为完成一个旅游胜地的建设争分夺秒，为国家荣誉做出了巨大牺牲。
"But the report in March in a North Korean state newspaper also revealed the economic dysfunction under Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader. Workers building up the city of Samjiyon, one of Kim’s marquee projects, were “breaking the frozen ground with hammers and chisels and carrying earth with stretchers and gunny sacks,” the report said.",但朝鲜一家官方报纸今年3月的这篇报道，也揭示出朝鲜领导人金正恩领导下的经济失调。报道称，参加三池渊建设的工人们正在“用锤子和凿子砸开冻土，用担架和麻袋运土”。三池渊是金正恩的重点项目之一。
"The report, in the newspaper Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the government, followed South Korean media reports of cases of pneumonia and frostbite in Samjiyon. Together they suggest that U.S.-led sanctions over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program are hurting Kim in a way they haven’t before: by targeting the state-run economy and the party and military elite who support his totalitarian rule.",政府喉舌《劳动新闻》的这篇报道是在韩国媒体报道了三池渊发生肺炎和冻伤病例后刊发的。把这些报道放在一起可看出，以美国为首的针对朝鲜核武器计划的制裁，通过把目标对准国有经济以及支持金正恩极权统治的党和军方精英，给金正恩带来了前所未有的烦恼。
"In that context, North Korea’s test of a “guided tactical weapon” on Thursday might be both a sign of his frustration and a warning to Washington that there will be no progress on nuclear disarmament unless the sanctions are eased.",朝鲜周四“战术制导武器”试验凸显了这一点，专家们认为这是对华盛顿有关制裁的警告。
"For years, the North Korean state has produced coal, iron ore, seafood and textiles for export, mostly to its ally China. Kim and top officials have used this export revenue, as well as the earnings of North Korean workers abroad, to finance nuclear weapons, large projects like Samjiyon and their own privileged lifestyles.",多年来，朝鲜一直把煤炭、铁矿石、海鲜和纺织品等产品用于出口，主要是出口到其盟友中国。金正恩和高级官员利用这些出口收入，以及朝鲜海外工人的收入，为三池渊这样的大型项目以及他们自己的特权生活方式提供资金。
"Previous international sanctions aimed to prevent North Korea from acquiring weapons parts and technology. But the newer ones, imposed in the past few years, ban those lucrative exports, depriving Kim’s regime of its main source of income.",此前的国际制裁以阻止朝鲜获得武器零部件和技术为目的。但过去几年实施的新制裁禁止了这些利润丰厚的出口产品，剥夺了金正恩政权的主要收入来源。
"As a result, party officials, soldiers and police officers who make a living off the state are feeling the effects more sharply than ordinary people who have already learned to fend for themselves through hundreds of unofficial markets, according to defectors and economists.",据脱北者和经济学家说，这些新制裁的结果是，靠政府谋生的党员干部、军人和警察感受到的影响，比普通人更剧烈，因为普通人已学会了通过数百个非官方市场自谋生路。
"“Hardest hit by sanctions are those 20-30% of the population who stay on the government’s socialist payroll and rations,” said Jiro Ishimaru, a Japanese journalist who monitors North Korea with the help of correspondents there. “Enterprising North Koreans can make as much in a day selling vegetables in the market as many military officers can make a month in official wages.”",“受制裁打击最严重的，是那些仍在政府领取社会主义工资和配给的20%至30%的人口，”日本记者石丸次郎(Jiro Ishimaru)说，他在当地通讯员的帮助下跟踪朝鲜的情况。“有创业精神的朝鲜人一天在市场上卖菜赚的钱，和许多军官一个月的官方工资一样多。”
"Five rounds of sanctions have been imposed by the United Nations Security Council since early 2016, when North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test. At the time, China and others argued that the sanctions would disproportionately affect ordinary North Koreans and could backfire.",自2016年初朝鲜进行第四次核试验以来，联合国安全理事会已实施了五轮制裁。当时，中国及其他方面曾声称，这些制裁会集中影响普通朝鲜百姓的生活，可能会事与愿违。
"Instead, the sanctions seem to be having an effect, with Chinese imports from North Korea falling 88% last year. U.S. officials have said that in February, when Kim and President Donald Trump went to Vietnam for their second summit meeting, North Korea asked the United States to lift these last five rounds of sanctions. North Korean officials have said they sought to lift only the sanctions affecting the civilian economy. The two leaders ended the meeting without an agreement, and negotiations have stalled since then.",相反，随着中国从朝鲜的进口去年下降88%，这些制裁似乎正在起作用。美国官员曾表示，当金正恩与特朗普总统2月份前往越南举行第二次峰会时，朝鲜要求美国取消最近五轮的制裁。朝鲜官员曾表示，他们只寻求取消影响民营经济的制裁。两位领导人未达成协议便终止了会谈，谈判自此陷于停顿。
"While the North Korean test this week was most likely a demonstration of a conventional weapons system, it suggested that Kim might resume nuclear and missile tests that he has suspended since November 2017. Earlier this month, he said the United States had until the end of the year to present a new proposal that would lift sanctions on the North.",虽然朝鲜本周的试验基本像是对已有武器体系的宣示，但它表明，金正恩可能会恢复他自2017年11月以来已暂停的核试验和导弹试验。本月早些时候，他曾表示，限美国在今年年底之前拿出一份取消对朝鲜制裁的新方案。
"In the meantime, Kim’s failure to secure sanctions relief has raised the question of how his supporters will respond.",与此同时，金正恩未能促成制裁取消也让人怀疑，他的支持者会如何回应。
"Even before the latest sanctions, monthly wages for the party and military elite were scarcely more than those of ordinary North Koreans. To supplement their state-provided income, they siphoned money from export industries and collected bribes from North Koreans seeking permission to work abroad or smuggle goods from China. Now, that income is drying up.",即使在最新几轮制裁之前，党员和军队干部的月工资也比普通朝鲜人高不了多少。为补贴国家发放的收入，他们从出口行业那里吸金，从寻求获准赴海外工作或从中国走私货物的朝鲜人那里收受贿赂。如今，这些收入正在枯竭。
"Adding to the officers’ humiliation, the sanctions have reduced their rations and forced their wives to help make ends meet as traders in the markets, defectors and economists say.",据脱北者和经济学家称，更令官员们羞愤的是，制裁导致他们的配给减少，迫使他们的妻子在集市上贩卖东西以补贴家用。
The struggles of the elite are a problem for Kim because he has staked his legacy not just on nuclear weapons but on making North Korea a “great socialist economic power.”,权贵阶层的困境对金正恩是个问题，因为他把他政治遗产的赌注不仅押在了核武器上，也押在了让朝鲜变成“伟大的社会主义经济强国”的愿景上。
"“The sanctions make it difficult for Kim Jong Un to execute the visions he has of bringing life into the economy once and for all,” said Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein, a fellow at the Philadelphia-based Foreign Policy Research Institute and editor of North Korean Economy Watch.",“制裁使金正恩难以实现他一举给本国经济注入生命力的愿景，”位于华盛顿的外交政策研究所(Foreign Policy Research Institute)研究员、网络媒体《朝鲜经济观察》(North Korean Economy Watch)编辑本杰明·卡策夫·希尔博斯坦(Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein)说。
"Though Kim still appears to be firmly in power, he could be threatened by unrest among the elites.",金正恩看起来仍牢牢掌握着权力，但他可能会受到权贵阶层躁动的威胁。
"“His biggest worry is that sanctions are squeezing the money flow for the elites, testing their loyalty,” said Joo Sung-ha, a North Korean defector who monitors the North as a journalist based in Seoul. “Losing the uniformed elites’ support means losing the bedrock of his rule.”",“他最大的担忧在于，制裁正在挤压精英们的经济来源，考验着他们的忠诚度，”以记者身份在首尔跟踪朝鲜局势的脱北者朱成夏（Joo Sung-ha，音）说。“失去步调一致的权贵的支持，意味着失去他执政的根基。”
"The state and market systems “are incompatible, given the different prices and wages each comes up with, so that strength in one often means weakness in the other,” said William Brown, a former CIA analyst who follows the North Korean economy.",国有体系和市场体系“互不相容，各自带来的价格和薪资水平皆不相同，因而其中一个的优势往往是另一个的弱势，”密切关注朝鲜经济的前中央情报局(CIA)分析师威廉·布朗(William Brown)说。
"That is apparent in the northeastern town of Musan, once the center of North Korea’s iron-ore production, where many donju investors have gone bankrupt since export routes were closed, said Ishimaru, the Japanese journalist. The miners, meanwhile, have been foraging for herbs to sell in the markets.",这一点在朝鲜北部城市茂山有充分体现。据日本记者石丸次郎称，自出口路径被关闭后，曾一度是朝鲜铁矿石生产中心的这里，有许多富有的投资者已破产。与此同时矿上的工人在寻觅草药拿到市场上卖。
"For now, there is no sign that the economy is reaching a breaking point, according to defectors in touch with their relatives in the North. The prices of rice, corn and fuel remain stable, and the won is holding steady against the U.S. dollar and Chinese yuan. North Korea also continues to conduct trade through illicit ship-to-ship transfers.",据与朝鲜亲戚保持联络的脱北者称，就目前而言，尚无迹象表明经济已濒临崩溃。大米、玉米和燃油价格依然稳定，朝鲜元对美元和人民币的汇率同样保持稳定。朝鲜还在继续通过不正规的船到船货物传送进行着贸易。
"But apartment prices in Pyongyang are declining, and the growing trade deficit with China is depleting North Korea’s foreign currency reserves. That lack of cash could put the government in a bind this summer, when the impact of what U.N. officials called the country’s worst harvest in more than a decade is most likely to be felt.",但平壤的住宅价格正在下降，同中国不断增长的贸易赤字也在耗尽朝鲜的外汇储备。现金的缺乏可能会令政府于今夏陷入困境，届时据联合国官员称为该国十年多来最严重的一次欠收极有可能会产生影响。
"“What he really wants, and needs, is dollars,” Brown said, referring to Kim’s attempt to get the sanctions lifted at the Vietnam meeting. “So he tossed the dice for a big win and lost his bet. I’m pretty sure he will be back for more negotiations soon.”",“他真正想要、急需的，是美元，”布朗说，他指的是金正恩在越南会谈中想要取消制裁的企图。“于是他掷了骰子，想大赢一把，结果赔了赌注。我相当确定，他不久就会回过头来举行更多会谈。”
"The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, produced a report of more than 400 pages that painted a deeply unflattering picture of President Trump but stopped short of accusing him of criminal wrongdoing. Here are seven takeaways.",特别检察官罗伯特·S·穆勒三世(Robert S. Mueller III)拿出了一份400多页的报告，描绘了一幅对特朗普总统很不利的画面，但没有对他发起任何刑事指控。以下是七个要点。
1. Trump did try to sabotage the investigation. His staff defied him.,1. 特朗普的确曾试图破坏调查。他的手下违抗了他。
"When Attorney General Jeff Sessions told Mr. Trump that a special counsel had been appointed in May 2017, Mr. Trump grew angry: “I’m fucked,” he said, believing his presidency was ruined. He told Mr. Sessions, “This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.”",当司法部长杰夫·塞申斯(Jeff Sessions)告诉特朗普，一名特别检察官已于2017年5月获得任命时，特朗普很生气：“我完蛋了，”他说，觉得自己的总统任期要毁了。他告诉塞申斯，“这是我经历过的最糟糕的事。”
"Mr. Trump began trying to get rid of Mr. Mueller, only to be thwarted by his staff. In instance after instance, his staff acted as a bulwark against Mr. Trump’s most destructive impulses. In June 2017, the president instructed Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, to remove Mr. Mueller, but Mr. McGahn resisted. Rather than carry out the president’s order, he decided he would rather resign.",特朗普开始尝试除掉穆勒，却遭到了自己手下的阻挠。一次又一次，他的手下像堡垒一样挡住特朗普最具破坏性的冲动。2017年6月，总统指示白宫法律顾问唐纳德·F·麦克加恩二世(Donald F. McGahn II)去撤换穆勒，但麦克加恩没有听从。他非但没有执行总统的命令，反而宁可决定辞职。
"Two days later, Mr. Trump asked another trusted adviser, Corey Lewandowski, to tell Mr. Sessions to end the investigation. Mr. Lewandowski did not want to, so he punted to a colleague, Rick Dearborn. He, too, “was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through.”",两天后，特朗普让另一位他信任的法律顾问科里·莱万多夫斯基(Corey Lewandowski)命令塞申斯结束调查。莱万多夫斯基不想这么做，于是把球踢给了同事里克·迪尔伯恩(Rick Dearborn)。后者也是“对这任务感到不自在，并且没有予以落实”。
2. So many lies. So many changed stories.,2. 太多谎言。太多改口的说法。
"One of the unanswered questions of the past two years — which helped fuel the F.B.I. investigation, congressional inquiries and journalistic scrutiny — is why so many people lied, changed their stories and issued misleading statements to both the public and federal authorities.",过去两年里，一个始终未解答的问题是，为何如此多的人撒了谎，更改了他们的说法，对公众以及联邦当局作了误导性声明。这个问题推动了联邦调查局(FBI)的调查、国会质询及新闻的审查。
The report recaps one false statement after another. Just a few examples:,报道对一则又一则假声明作了简短概括。仅举几例：
"Mr. Trump was livid when journalists revealed that he had unsuccessfully ordered Mr. Mueller’s firing. The president tried to get Mr. McGahn to say publicly that was false, but Mr. McGahn refused, saying that the news reports were accurate. Mr. Mueller’s report notably declared that Mr. McGahn was “credible.”",当记者披露特朗普曾下令解雇穆勒未果后，他大发雷霆。总统曾想让麦克加恩公开否认此事，但麦克加恩拒绝了，称该新闻报道准确无误。穆勒的报告明确宣称，麦克加恩是“可信的”。
"Mr. Trump also pressed the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, to give a news conference about the firing of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey. The White House press office wanted Mr. Rosenstein to say it was his idea. Mr. Rosenstein told the president that a news conference was a bad idea “because if the press asked him, he would tell the truth.”",特朗普还曾迫使司法部副部长罗德·J·罗森斯坦(Rod J. Rosenstein)召开关于FBI局长詹姆斯·B·科米(James B. Comey)被解职的新闻发布会。白宫新闻办公室想让罗森斯坦说那是他的主意。罗森斯坦告诉总统，召开新闻发布会不是个好主意，“因为如果媒体问起他，他会说出实情。”
"The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, admitted issuing a statement to the news media “in the heat of the moment that was not founded on anything.”",白宫新闻秘书萨拉·赫卡比·桑德斯(Sarah Huckabee Sanders)承认“因为冲动，在毫无依据的情况下”向新闻媒体发布了一份声明。
3. Fake news? Not so much.,3. 假新闻？没那么多。
"The president has spent the past two years denouncing the news media. He has repeatedly accused reporters of making up sources to destroy his presidency. The report, though, shows not only that some of the most unflattering stories about Mr. Trump were accurate, but also that White House officials knew that was the case even as they heaped criticism on journalists.",总统过去两年来一直在谴责新闻媒体。他曾多次指责记者捏造消息来源，想要毁了他的总统位子。但这份报告显示，不仅一些关于特朗普最不光彩的报道准确无误，而且白宫官员也清楚情况确实如此，即便他们没少批评记者。
"In May 2017, for instance, The New York Times disclosed that Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Comey to end the F.B.I.’s investigation into the president’s national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. Mr. Trump tweeted, “I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!”",例如，《纽约时报》曾于2017年5月披露特朗普要求科米终止FBI对总统国家安全顾问迈克尔·T·弗林(Michael T. Flynn)的调查。特朗普发推称，“我从未要求科米停止调查弗林。这不过是掩盖科米又一个谎言的更多假新闻！”
"“Despite those denials,” Mr. Mueller wrote, “substantial evidence corroborates Comey’s account.”",“即便他们作了这些否认，”穆勒写道，“大量证据仍然证实了科米的说法。”
"In another instance, Mr. Trump appeared to use criticism of the news media as a legal strategy. He attacked a Times article suggesting that his former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, might cooperate with the Justice Department and provide information about Mr. Trump.",还有一次，特朗普似乎把批评新闻媒体当作法律策略来使用。他攻击了时报一篇文章，该文暗示他的前律师迈克尔·科恩(Michael D. Cohen)可能会与司法部合作，提供关于特朗普的信息。
"That tweet coincided with outreach to Mr. Cohen by Mr. Trump’s associates, and Mr. Cohen understood that this was all part of an effort to get him to “stay on message and be part of the team.”",这则推文与特朗普的副手向科恩示好的时间恰好一致，科恩也明白这全都是让他“保持忠心、团结一致”努力的一部分。
4. No obstruction? Not so fast.,4. 没有妨碍司法？并不能完全肯定。
Mr. Trump was quick to declare the report a total vindication.,特朗普很快宣布，这份报告完全可以证明自己的无辜。
But federal authorities went out of their way not to exonerate Mr. Trump. They wrote that his conduct in office “presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred.”,但联邦当局并没有特地排除他。他们写道，特朗普在任期间的行为“造成了一些困难的问题，阻碍我们最终确定没有发生犯罪行为”。
5. Evading an F.B.I. interview proved a successful strategy.,5. 逃避联邦调查局的问讯被证明是成功的策略。
"Mr. Trump repeatedly said he was eager to sit for an interview with Mr. Mueller’s team, despite his lawyers’ insistence that doing so would be a terrible idea.",特朗普多次表示，他很想接受穆勒团队的问讯，尽管他的律师坚称，这样做很不好。
"The report makes clear why his lawyers were so worried about it. Mr. Mueller had a huge cache of unanswered questions, misleading and conflicting statements, and unexplained actions with which to confront the president. Sitting for an interview, the report makes clear, would have exposed Mr. Trump to far more problems.",这份报告清楚地说明了他的律师为何如此担心。穆勒有大量未经解答的问题、误导性和相互矛盾的陈述，以及无法解释的行动，要向总统质询。报告明确指出，如果接受问讯，会让特朗普面对更多问题。
Mr. Mueller said he chose not to subpoena the president because a court fight would delay the investigation. But that decision meant that the authorities were never able to ask the central question in the obstruction case: What was Mr. Trump thinking when he tried repeatedly to undermine the federal investigation?,穆勒说，他之所以选择不传唤总统，是因为法庭上的争斗会推迟调查。但这一决定意味着，当局永远无法在这起妨碍司法案中提出核心问题：当特朗普一再试图破坏联邦调查时，他在想什么?
"6. No evidence of conspiracy, but lots of reason to investigate.",6. 没有实施阴谋的证据，但有很多调查的理由。
Mr. Mueller makes explicit what Mr. Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on: Russia secretly manipulated the 2016 presidential election.,穆勒明确指出了特朗普一再质疑的问题：俄罗斯暗中操纵了2016年的总统大选。
"The investigation ultimately found no evidence that anyone from Mr. Trump’s campaign participated in that effort, but the report reveals in stark detail the many suspicious interactions that had the F.B.I. so worried. Many of those have been reported, but the report amounts to a compendium that helps explain the origins of the F.B.I. investigation, known as “Crossfire Hurricane.”",调查最终没有发现任何证据，表明特朗普竞选团队中的任何人参与了这一行动，但这份报告详尽地揭示了令联邦调查局担忧的许多可疑互动。其中很多已经被报道过，但这份报告相当于一个概要，有助于解释联邦调查局调查的起源，即“火力飓风”(Crossfire Hurricane)调查。
"For instance, it has long been known that George Papadopoulos, a young campaign aide, was told that the Russian government had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails. But the report goes much further, revealing that Mr. Papadopoulos suggested an explicit offer by the Russian government to work with the Trump campaign to sabotage Mrs. Clinton.",例如，人们早就知道，年轻的竞选团队助手乔治·帕帕佐普洛斯(George Papadopoulos)被告知，俄罗斯政府有希拉里•克林顿(Hillary Clinton)的“黑料”，即数千封电子邮件。但这份报告走得更远，显示帕帕佐普洛斯建议俄罗斯政府明确提出与特朗普竞选团队合作，破坏克林顿。
7. Imagine reading this report cold.,7. 试想在毫不知情的情况下阅读该报告。
"Prosecutors describe a president who was preoccupied with ending a federal investigation, a White House that repeatedly told misleading and changing stories, and a presidential campaign that was in repeated contact with Russian officials for reasons that are not always clear.",在检察官的描述中，总统专注于结束联邦调查，白宫反复讲述误导性和前后不一的故事，总统竞选团队与俄罗斯官员反复接触，而接触的原因并不总是很清楚。
"Even though prosecutors concluded that didn’t amount to provably criminal conduct, the report is astounding in its sweep. Yet it is also a reminder of how much the public has learned over the past two years about Mr. Trump’s conduct.",尽管检察官的结论是，这并不构成可证明的犯罪行为，但这份报告的内容之广令人震惊。然而，这也提醒人们，过去两年里，公众对特朗普的行为已经了解了多少。
"If the American public or members of Congress were learning these things for the first time, the political fallout would normally be devastating. The consequences of the report remain to be seen, but if people are not surprised or shocked by the revelations, then Mr. Trump may have benefited by the steady drip of news stories he has so loudly criticized.",如果美国公众或国会议员是第一次了解这些事情，政治后果通常会是毁灭性的。这份报告的后果还有待观察，但如果人们对披露的情况不感到意外或震惊，那么特朗普可能已经从不断泄露的相关新闻报道中受益，尽管他对此一直大声批评这些报道。
"Donald J. Trump has referred to China as “our enemy.” He has called it “a major threat.” “Remember,” he once wrote on Twitter, “China is not a friend of the United States!”",唐纳德·J·特朗普(Donald J. Trump)称中国为“我们的敌人”。谓之“一大威胁”。“记住，”他曾在Twitter上写道，“中国不是美国的朋友！”
Some people in China have their own label for the polarizing American president: savior.,对于这位让公众意见两极分化的美国总统，中国一些人有自己的标签：救世主。
"At dinner tables, in social media chats and in discreet conversations, some of the country’s intellectual and business elite are half-jokingly, half-seriously cheering on the leader who has built a large part of his political career on China-bashing.",在餐桌上、在社交媒体聊天时、在谨慎的交谈中，中国一些知识分子和商界精英半开玩笑半认真地为这位领导人喝彩。特朗普政治生涯的很大一部分是建立在猛烈抨击中国之上的。
"“Only Trump can save China,” goes one quip. Others call him the “chief pressure officer” of China’s reform and opening.",“只有特朗普才能救中国，”有俏皮话这样说。还有人称他为中国改革开放的“总倒逼师”。
"Their semi-serious praise reflects the deepening despair among those in China who fear their country is on the wrong track. An aggressive outsider like President Trump, according to this thinking, can help China find its way again.",他们半认真的赞扬反映出一些中国人日益加深的绝望情绪，他们担心自己的国家正走上错误的道路。照他们看来，像特朗普总统这样好斗的局外人，能帮助中国重新找到方向。
"The Communist Party has become more involved in business, the economy, public discourse and other elements of everyday life. Many of these elite fear that after 40 years of reform and opening up, China is retreating. To make matters worse, nobody at home appears willing or able to fight the trend. President Xi Jinping has become the country’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, hurting the chances that internal opposition can push back.",共产党越来越多地参与到商业、经济、公共话语，以及其他日常生活中来。这些精英中的许多人担心，中国在经历了40年的改革开放之后正在倒退。让事情更糟糕的是，国内似乎没有人愿意或有能力抗拒这种趋势。国家主席习近平已成为自毛泽东以来中国最有权力的领导人，这令国内反对派的机会变得渺茫。
"Then came Mr. Trump and his trade war. Among other demands, American negotiators are calling on China to play a smaller role in the country’s economy. They want the Chinese government to stop throwing money at state-controlled companies. They want lower trade barriers and a level playing field for private businesses.",后来，来了特朗普和他的贸易战。美国谈判代表提出的各项要求中，包括呼吁中国在国民经济中起到更小作用。他们希望中国政府停止向国有企业砸钱。希望降低贸易壁垒，为私营企业提供公平的竞争环境。
"That puts Mr. Trump, oddly, in sync with a number of Chinese intellectuals and business types. Should the Communist Party step back from the economy, their thinking goes, it might have to loosen its tight grip over rest of the society, too.",这让特朗普与许多中国知识分子和商界人士有着奇怪的一致性。这些人的看法是，如果共产党退出经济领域，可能也会不得不放松对社会其他方面的严格管控。
"“The trade war is a good thing,” said Zhu Ning, an economist at Tsinghua University in Beijing. “It gives us hope when we’re hopeless.”",“贸易战是件好事，”清华大学经济学家朱宁说。“在我们绝望的时候，贸易战给了我们希望。”
"“The various demands by the U.S. government could force us to carry on with the reforms,” said Tao Jingzhou, a partner at the law firm Dechert’s Beijing office. “There’s a Chinese saying that carrying out a reform is equivalent to a man cutting off his own arm, which is very hard. It might help if someone else forces you to do it.”",“美国的各种要求可能会逼迫我们不得不推动进一步的改革，”德杰律师事务所(Dechert)北京办事处合伙人陶景洲说。“改革就是壮士断臂。自己砍自己的胳膊当然很难，除非别人逼着你，帮你砍。”
"Even some retired officials have said they believe that the trade war could have positive effects. Long Yongtu, who led the negotiations for China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, said at a forum last month that trade friction could be “a good thing.”",甚至一些退下来的官员也说，他们认为贸易战可能会带来积极影响。曾主持中国加入世贸谈判的龙永图上月在某论坛上说，贸易摩擦可能是“好的事情”。
"It could be “a healthy pressure that pushes China to move forward,” he said.",它可以说是“一个健康压力，不断地在推动中国往前走”，他说。
The chances that Mr. Trump alone can change China's ways are exceedingly slim. The Communist Party risks looking weak if it agrees to too many of his demands. True reform would have to come from inside.,单凭特朗普一人改变中国行事方式的几率极其渺茫。如果同意了太多他的要求，共产党可能会显得软弱。真正的改革必须来自内部。
"“We can’t count on the external force to save China,” said Wang Gongquan, a billionaire liberal activist and former venture capitalist. He was among the first group of people who were detained or jailed after the party intensified the crackdown on dissent and civil disobedience six years ago.",“拯救中国肯定不能靠外部力量，”亿万富翁、自由派活动人士、前风险投资人王功权说。六年前，共产党加大了对异见人士和非暴力反抗的打压，他是第一批被拘留或监禁的人。
"“Changes will only come,” Mr. Wang added, “when responsible people inside and outside the government push for it together.”",“一定是，”王功权接着说，“这个国家体制内外负责任的人共同作用的结果。”
"Still, the hopes about Mr. Trump acknowledge the role the outside world has played in China’s gradual opening over the past four decades. Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, the Communist Party has largely been a reluctant reformer, often pushed and lured by internal and external forces.",但对特朗普所寄予的希望，承认了过去四十年来，外界在中国的逐步开放中所起的作用。自文化大革命结束以来，共产党在很大程度上一直是不情愿的改革者，往往是受到内部和外部力量的推动和诱导。
"Even some in the Trump administration seem to be hoping that internal voices will speak up. In an interview with National Public Radio, Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator, was asked about the likelihood that the trade war would lead to changes in China.",甚至特朗普政府中的一些人似乎也寄希望于内部声音能出来说话。在接受全国公共广播电台(National Public Radio) 采访时，特朗普的首席谈判代表罗伯特·莱特希泽(Robert Lighthizer)被问及贸易战能在多大程度上促使中国发生变革。
"“You have to start with the proposition that there are people in China who believe that reform is a good idea,” Mr. Lighthizer said. “And you have to believe that those people are at a very senior level.”",“你得先从这样的见解开始，即在中国，有人相信改革是个好主意，”莱特希泽说。“而且你得相信这些人处在非常高层的位置。”
The challenge now will be to find those internal voices in a time when dissent can be quickly squelched.,现在的挑战是，在异见可能被迅速压制之前，找到这样的内部声音。
"“Unfortunately, there’s no force to be joined with in China,” Liu Suli, a liberal thinker and enthusiastic Trump supporter who founded an independent bookstore in Beijing. “There’s only a pool of stagnant water.”",“但是国内没有任何力量可以联合，”自由派思想家、特朗普的热心支持者刘苏里说，他是北京一家独立书店的创办者。“只有一潭死水。”
The breadth of support for Mr. Trump in China isn’t clear. Many business leaders dare not speak out for fear of angering the Communist Party.,特朗普在中国所获支持的广泛程度尚不明确。但许多商界领袖不敢发声，担心惹怒共产党。
"The talk is hard to miss. The first time I heard the “Only Trump can save China” quip was a few months ago from a self-described apolitical tech entrepreneur in Guangdong Province in southern China. He complained about rising taxes and growing government interference in the economy. He was worried that if his start-up failed, he could end up on a newly created blacklist that would prevent him from taking flights and checking in at some hotels.",人们的议论相当多。我第一次听到“只有特朗普才能救中国”的讽刺是在几个月前，出自南部广东省一名自称不关心政治的科技企业家。他抱怨税收增加，以及政府越来越多地插手经济。他担心，一旦他的初创企业倒闭，到头来可能会出现在一个新创建的黑名单上，那样他便无法搭乘飞机或入住某些酒店。
"This image of Mr. Trump is often at odds with reality. Supporters of his who have long pushed China on human rights are cheering a president who wants to make it harder for migrants fleeing political persecution to find sanctuary in the United States. It’s a strange disconnect to listen to graying activists — educated free thinkers, some of whom have gone to prison for their ideals — put their hopes in a man who openly admires autocrats and calls journalists “the enemy of the people.”",特朗普的这一形象往往与现实相悖。那些长期在人权问题上给中国施压的特朗普支持者们所欢呼的，是一位想要使逃离政治迫害的移民在美国寻求避难变得更为困难的总统。听见白发苍苍活动人士——受过教育的自由思想者，其中一些因他们的理想而蹲过监狱——把希望寄托在一个公开崇拜独裁者、称记者是“人民的公敌”的人身上，这是个很奇怪的落差。
"Optimists nevertheless point to signs that they say show Mr. Trump is having an impact. Facing both the trade war and a slowdown in growth that began in the middle of last year, China’s leadership has embraced some modest liberalization. The government has promised to cut taxes, ease other burdens on the private sector and give markets a somewhat bigger role in the economy.",但乐观派仍会指出，有迹象表明特朗普正在产生影响。由于要同时面对贸易战以及去年年中开始的经济增长放缓问题，中国领导层已经接受了某种适度的自由化。政府已承诺减税、减轻民营部门负担，并让市场在经济中发挥更大作用。
"“More market-oriented actions are being reconsidered or put back on the table,” said Mr. Zhu, the Tsinghua economist. “In this sense, the trade war is helping China’s reform.”",“更多以市场为导向的举措正在重新考虑当中或重新拿出来讨论，”清华大学经济学家朱宁说。“从这个角度讲，贸易战确实促进了中国改革。”
"But there’s little evidence that the leadership is easing its grip in a lasting way. The few business-friendly gestures are reactive rather than proactive. In other words, there hasn’t been any fundamental change in the leadership’s thinking. The party must control, as Mr. Xi has said, “all tasks.”",但鲜有证据表明，中国的领导层正在以持久的方式放松管控。为数不多的企业友好表态是应对之举，而不是主动求变。换言之，领导层的想法并没有根本性的改变。正如习近平所说，党必须控制“一切工作”。
"Some Chinese supporters of Mr. Trump, particularly dissidents or those living in exile, believe that he plans something bigger: regime change. Liu Junning, a pro-democracy dissident in Beijing, pointed to Vice President Mike Pence’s stern speech in October in which he accused China of numerous offenses over the years. Mr. Liu also pointed to Venezuela, where the Trump administration has pushed for new leadership.",特朗普在中国的一些支持者，特别是异见人士或流亡人士，认为他有更大的计划：政权更迭。北京的民主异见人士刘军宁指出，副总统迈克·彭斯(Mike Pence)在去年10月份发表了措辞严厉的讲话，指责中国多年来犯下无数罪行。刘军宁还举了委内瑞拉的例子，特朗普政府已在该国推动新的领导层上台。
"In part, this group believes past presidents were too soft on China’s Communist Party. But they also cite the patina of toughness that Mr. Trump accumulated in his pre-political days. Mr. Liu cited Mr. Trump’s book “The Art of the Deal” and his reality TV show, “The Apprentice.”",在某种程度上，这一群体认为往届总统对中共太过心慈手软。但他们也会引述特朗普在参政前给人留下的强硬印象。刘军宁引述了特朗普的著作《交易的艺术》(The Art of the Deal)和他的电视真人秀节目《学徒》(The Apprentice)。
"“Trump’s approach is that he gives you a task and he expects you to get it done. Otherwise, you’re fired,” Mr. Liu said, alluding to the reality show. “He can be very tough.”",“川普做事的手段是，我给你一个任务，你必须达到，做不到，You’re fired.（你被解雇了——译注）”刘军宁说，暗指真人秀。“他会很强硬。”
"How tough he will be about fixing China’s economy still isn’t clear. In public comments, Mr. Trump has focused on getting China to buy more American goods. His advisers have said he will press for economic reforms, but any pledge by China to cut subsidies to state-owned companies or favored industries would be difficult to verify, much less enforce.",他对解决中国的经济问题会有多强硬尚不明确。在公开表态中，特朗普一直着眼于让中国购买更多美国产品。他的顾问曾表示，他会推动经济改革，但中国减少对国有企业或受青睐行业补贴的承诺将很难查证，更不用提执行。
"“I don’t think helping China to reform is Trump’s main political goal,” Mr. Zhu said. “He may just want something to tweet about.”",“我不觉得帮助中国改革是川普的主要政治考虑，”朱宁说。“他可能只是想借此发发推文。”
